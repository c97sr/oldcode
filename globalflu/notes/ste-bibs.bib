title = {Prevalence of Schistosoma japonicum infection of Oncomelania quadrasi snail colonies in 50 irrigated and rain-fed villages of Samar Province, the Philippines},
abstract = {A cross-sectional survey of Oncomelania quadrasi, the intermediate host for Schistosoma japonicum, was conducted between 2004 and 2005 in 50 villages of the Province of Samar, the Philippines. The villages were classified as rain-fed (25) or with some man-made irrigation system (25). The primary objective was to identify all snail colony sites in the 50 villages and to compare snail population density and S. japonicum infection prevalence between the two types of villages. The presence of snail colonies was surveyed along streams, springs, various canals and swampy areas or grass land. A total of 198 colony sites were identified out of the 845 sites surveyed. Of these, a sufficient number of O. quadrasi snails were identified to measure density and infection in 147 sites. Density of O. quadrasi was remarkably uniform across habitats and there were no significant differences across habitats and between village type. The prevalence of infected snails showed more variability among habitats. Indeed, there was an interaction between the type of habitat and the type of village with irrigated villages being associated with a prevalence proportion ratio of 5.76 (1.31, 25.42) as compared to rain-fed villages among streams and springs. No such association was found among other habitats. The results suggest that once a suitable habitat exists, O. quadrasi populations establish and reach a plateau density. These results are discussed in light of possible ecological measures of control.},

title = {Influenza-associated hospitalizations in the United States},
abstract = {CONTEXT: Respiratory viral infections are responsible for a large number of hospitalizations in the United States each year. OBJECTIVE: To estimate annual influenza-associated hospitalizations in the United States by hospital discharge category, discharge type, and age group. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) data and World Health Organization Collaborating Laboratories influenza surveillance data were used to estimate annual average numbers of hospitalizations associated with the circulation of influenza viruses from the 1979-1980 through the 2000-2001 seasons in the United States using age-specific Poisson regression models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We estimated influenza-associated hospitalizations for primary and any listed pneumonia and influenza and respiratory and circulatory hospitalizations. RESULTS: Annual averages of 94,735 (range, 18,908-193,561) primary and 133,900 (range, 30,757-271,529) any listed pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations were associated with influenza virus infections. Annual averages of 226,54 (range, 54,523-430,960) primary and 294,128 (range, 86,494-544,909) any listed respiratory and circulatory hospitalizations were associated with influenza virus infections. Persons 85 years or older had the highest rates of influenza-associated primary respiratory and circulatory hospitalizations (1194.9 per 100,000 persons). Children younger than 5 years (107.9 primary respiratory and circulatory hospitalizations per 100,000 persons) had rates similar to persons aged 50 through 64 years. Estimated rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations were highest during seasons in which A(H3N2) viruses predominated, followed by B and A(H1N1) seasons. After adjusting for the length of each influenza season, influenza-associated primary pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations increased over time among the elderly. There were no significant increases in influenza-associated primary respiratory and circulatory hospitalizations after adjusting for the length of the influenza season. CONCLUSIONS: Significant numbers of influenza-associated hospitalizations in the United States occur among the elderly, and the numbers of these hospitalizations have increased substantially over the last 2 decades due in part to the aging of the population. Children younger than 5 years had rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations similar to those among individuals aged 50 through 64 years. These findings highlight the need for improved influenza prevention efforts for both young and older US residents.},

abstract = {We present a method for the simultaneous estimation of the basic reproductive number, R(0), and the serial interval for infectious disease epidemics, using readily available surveillance data. These estimates can be obtained in real time to inform an appropriate public health response to the outbreak. We show how this methodology, in its most simple case, is related to a branching process and describe similarities between the two that allow us to draw parallels which enable us to understand some of the theoretical properties of our estimators. We provide simulation results that illustrate the efficacy of the method for estimating R(0) and the serial interval in real time. Finally, we implement our proposed method with data from three infectious disease outbreaks.},

title = {Containing pandemic influenza at the source},
abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (subtype H5N1) is threatening to cause a human pandemic of potentially devastating proportions. We used a stochastic influenza simulation model for rural Southeast Asia to investigate the effectiveness of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, quarantine, and pre-vaccination in containing an emerging influenza strain at the source. If the basic reproductive number (R0) was below 1.60, our simulations showed that a prepared response with targeted antivirals would have a high probability of containing the disease. In that case, an antiviral agent stockpile on the order of 100,000 to 1 million courses for treatment and prophylaxis would be sufficient. If pre-vaccination occurred, then targeted antiviral prophylaxis could be effective for containing strains with an R0 as high as 2.1. Combinations of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, pre-vaccination, and quarantine could contain strains with an R(0) as high as 2.4.},

I argue on why it has taken so long for the concept to mature in epidemiology when there were ample opportunities for cross-fertilisation from demography and ecology from where it reached adulthood fifty years earlier. Today, R0 is a more fully developed adult in epidemiology than in demography. In the final section I give an algorithm for its calculation in heterogeneous populations.},

abstract = {During the containment phase in the United Kingdom (April to June 2009), a cluster of influenza A(H1N1)v cases was identified prompting further investigation and public health action by the Health Protection Agency. The first confirmed case, a pupil at a school in England, was imported. During the following two weeks, 16 further cases were confirmed with epidemiological links to the first imported case. In this cluster, we found that significant transmission occurred in two classes with attack rates of 17.4% and 7.4%. In each of the two classes a case had attended school whilst symptomatic. Other settings included a choir and a party. Minimum and maximum attack rates were 3.6% and 4.2% for the choir and 14.3% and 25% for the party. We did not find any evidence of transmission on two school bus trips despite exposure over 50 minutes to a symptomatic case and over two periods of 30 minutes to a case during the prodromal phase (i.e. within 12 hours of symptom onset). Nor was there onward transmission in another school despite exposure over several hours to two cases, both of whom attended school during the prodromal phase.},

This paper reviewed the experiences of the national control program, then the author considered it essential to put forward a newly sustainable strategy with an emphasis on the areas with high endemicity of schistosomiasis, on poverty-stricken areas, especially in the Western part of the People's Republic of China, when taking into account both the opportunities and challenges of the future. It is expected that the schistosomiasis control program with a sustainable strategy would promote local economic development in the People's Republic of China.},

title = {Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever},
abstract = {Dengue fever, a very old disease, has reemerged in the past 20 years with an expanded geographic distribution of both the viruses and the mosquito vectors, increased epidemic activity, the development of hyperendemicity (the cocirculation of multiple serotypes), and the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever in new geographic regions. In 1998 this mosquito-borne disease is the most important tropical infectious disease after malaria, with an estimated 100 million cases of dengue fever, 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever, and 25,000 deaths annually. The reasons for this resurgence and emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the waning years of the 20th century are complex and not fully understood, but demographic, societal, and public health infrastructure changes in the past 30 years have contributed greatly. This paper reviews the changing epidemiology of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever by geographic region, the natural history and transmission cycles, clinical diagnosis of both dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever, serologic and virologic laboratory diagnoses, pathogenesis, surveillance, prevention, and control. A major challenge for public health officials in all tropical areas of the world is to develop and implement sustainable prevention and control programs that will reverse the trend of emergent dengue hemorrhagic fever.},

Under base-case assumptions (including a fixed stockpile that was smaller than the clinical attack rate), the treat-only option (treating all symptomatic patients with AV drugs) would be considered cost-effective ( pound1,900- pound13,700 per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained, depending on the fatality scenario), compared with no intervention (nonintervention but management of cases as they arise). The test-treat option (testing all symptomatic patients but treating those with positive tests results only) would result in moderate gains in QALYs over the treat-only option but at relatively large additional costs. Stockpiling sufficient AV drugs (but not near-patient tests) to treat all patients with clinical cases would be cost-effective, provided AV drugs are effective at preventing deaths from pandemic influenza.},

title = {Estimating the costs of school closure for mitigating an influenza pandemic},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: School closure is a key component of many countries' plans to mitigate the effect of an influenza pandemic. Although a number of studies have suggested that such a policy might reduce the incidence, there are no published studies of the cost of such policies. This study attempts to fill this knowledge gap METHODS: School closure is expected to lead to significant work absenteeism of working parents who are likely to be the main care givers to their dependent children at home. The cost of absenteeism due to school closure is calculated as the paid productivity loss of parental absenteeism during the period of school closure. The cost is estimated from societal perspective using a nationally representative survey. RESULTS: The results show that overall about 16% of the workforce is likely to be the main caregiver for dependent children and therefore likely to take absenteeism. This rises to 30% in the health and social care sector, as a large proportion of the workforce are women. The estimated costs of school closure are significant, at 0.2 pounds bn - 1.2 pounds bn per week. School closure is likely to significantly exacerbate the pressures on the health system through staff absenteeism. CONCLUSION: The estimates of school closure associated absenteeism and the projected cost would be useful for pandemic planning for business continuity, and for cost effectiveness evaluation of different pandemic influenza mitigation strategies.},

title = {Finding optimal vaccination strategies for pandemic influenza using genetic algorithms},
abstract = {In the event of pandemic influenza, only limited supplies of vaccine may be available. We use stochastic epidemic simulations, genetic algorithms (GA), and random mutation hill climbing (RMHC) to find optimal vaccine distributions to minimize the number of illnesses or deaths in the population, given limited quantities of vaccine. Due to the non-linearity, complexity and stochasticity of the epidemic process, it is not possible to solve for optimal vaccine distributions mathematically. However, we use GA and RMHC to find near optimal vaccine distributions. We model an influenza pandemic that has age-specific illness attack rates similar to the Asian pandemic in 1957-1958 caused by influenza A(H2N2), as well as a distribution similar to the Hong Kong pandemic in 1968-1969 caused by influenza A(H3N2). We find the optimal vaccine distributions given that the number of doses is limited over the range of 10-90% of the population. While GA and RMHC work well in finding optimal vaccine distributions, GA is significantly more efficient than RMHC. We show that the optimal vaccine distribution found by GA and RMHC is up to 84% more effective than random mass vaccination in the mid range of vaccine availability. GA is generalizable to the optimization of stochastic model parameters for other infectious diseases and population structures.},

abstract = {A large outbreak of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus (swine origin influenza virus [S-OIV]) infection in Milwaukee, WI, occurred in late April 2009. We had recently developed a rapid multiplex reverse transcription-PCR enzyme hybridization assay (FluPlex) to determine the type (A or B) and subtype (H1, H2, H3, H5, H7, H9, N1 [human], N1 [animal], N2, or N7) of influenza viruses, and this assay was used to confirm the diagnoses for the first infected patients in the state. The analytical sensitivity was excellent at 1.5 to 116 copies/reaction, or 10(-3) to 10(-1) 50% tissue culture infective doses/ml. The testing of all existing hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes of influenza A virus and influenza B virus (41 influenza virus strains) and 24 common respiratory pathogens showed only one low-level H3 cross-reaction with an H10N7 avian strain and only at 5.2 x 10(6) copies/reaction, not at lower concentrations. Comparisons of the FluPlex results with results from multiple validated in-house molecular assays, CDC-validated FDA-approved assays, and gene sequencing demonstrated 100% positive agreement for the typing of 179 influenza A viruses and 3 influenza B viruses, the subtyping of 110 H1N1 (S-OIV; N1 [animal]), 62 H1N1 (human), and 6 H3N2 (human) viruses, and the identification of 24 negative clinical samples and 100% negative agreement for all viruses tested except H1N1 (human) (97.7%). The small number of false-positive H1N1 (human) samples most likely represent increased sensitivity over that of other in-house assays, with four of four results confirmed by the CDC's influenza virus subtyping assay. The FluPlex is a rapid, inexpensive, sensitive, and specific method for the typing and subtyping of influenza viruses and demonstrated outstanding utility during the first 2 weeks of an S-OIV infection outbreak. Methods for rapid detection and broad subtyping of influenza viruses, including animal subtypes, are needed to address public concern over the emergence of pandemic strains. Attempts to automate this assay are ongoing.},

title = {An analysis of foot-and-mouth-disease epidemics in the UK},
abstract = {There was a major epidemic of the foot-and-mouth-disease virus among cattle herds in the UK in 1967-68 which showed a very rapid early spread, a much slower later spread, and eventually infected 12% of herds in the core epidemic area. A simple discrete-time version of a susceptible-latent-infectious-removed epidemiological model is used to generate a set of estimates of the transmission rate. This parameter has high values over the first few days, then the values are lower and they subsequently decline. The early high values are consistent with the view that unusual meteorological conditions produced exceptionally good conditions for wind-borne spread of the virus over the first few days. The corresponding basic reproduction number, Rzero, is estimated as 38.4. Subsequent low values of the transmission rate correspond to a value of Rzero of 2.0; this is within the range of estimates made from the observed ratio of secondary to primary outbreaks for 25 other epidemics. Prophylactic control measures, such as vaccination, would have to be extremely effective to prevent epidemics with the higher Rzero value.},

title = {Estimating antiviral effectiveness against pandemic influenza using household data},
abstract = {Current estimates of antiviral effectiveness for influenza are based on the existing strains of the virus. Should a pandemic strain emerge, strain-specific estimates will be required as early as possible to ensure that antiviral stockpiles are used optimally and to compare the benefits of using antivirals as prophylaxis or to treat cases. We present a method to measure antiviral effectiveness using early pandemic data on household outbreak sizes, including households that are provided with antivirals for prophylaxis and those provided with antivirals for treatment only. We can assess whether antiviral drugs have a significant impact on susceptibility or on infectivity with the data from approximately 200 to 500 households with a primary case. Fewer households will suffice if the data can be collected before case numbers become high, and estimates are more precise if the study includes data from prophylaxed households and households where no antivirals are provided. Rates of asymptomatic infection and the level of transmissibility of the virus do not affect the accuracy of these estimates greatly, but the pattern of infectivity in the individual strongly influences the estimate of the effect of antivirals on infectivity. An accurate characterization of the infectiousness profile-informed by strain-specific data-is essential for measuring antiviral effectiveness.},

title = {Cross-sectional associations between intensity of animal and human infection with Schistosoma japonicum in Western Samar province, Philippines},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between the intensity of animal infection with Schistosoma japonicum and human infection in Western Samar province, the Philippines. METHODS: We conducted an observational cross-sectional study of 1425 households in 50 villages. Stool samples were collected on each of 1-3 days from 5623 humans, 1275 cats, 1189 dogs, 1899 pigs, 663 rats and 873 water buffalo. Intensity of infection with S. japonicum was measured by the number of eggs per gram (EPG). Egg counts were done using the Kato-Katz method. We used a Bayesian hierarchical cumulative logit model, with adjustments for age, sex, occupation and measurement error. FINDINGS: The adjusted proportions of humans lightly infected (classified as 1-100 EPG) was 17.7% (95% Bayesian credible interval = 15.3-20.2%); the proportion classified as at least moderately infected (>100 EPG) was 3.2% (2.2-4.6%). The crude parasitological results for animals indicated that 37 cats (2.9%), 228 dogs (19.2%), 39 pigs (2.1%), 199 rats (30.0%) and 28 water buffalo (3.2%) were infected. In univariate analyses the odds ratios corresponding to a unit increase in the mean number of EPG at the village-level in dogs was 1.05 (1.01-1.09), in cats 1.35 (1.02-1.78), in pigs 1.16 (0.24- 5.18) and in rats 1.00 (1.00-1.01). Mean EPG values in cats, dogs, pigs and rats were correlated with one another. This confounding made interpreting the odds ratios difficult, but the odds ratios for dogs and cats were more consistent. CONCLUSION: S. japonicum is endemic in areas of the Philippines despite implementation of control programmes. This may be due to the association of infections in dogs and cats with human infections. Infection control in dogs and cats is challenging, and there is a need to develop new methods to control transmission across all species.},

abstract = {The authors report on a community-based, nonrandomized, open-label study, conducted during the 2000-2001 influenza season in Temple-Belton, Texas, of the protective effectiveness of trivalent, cold-adapted, influenza virus vaccine (CAIV-T) in children aged 18 months-18 years. The dominant circulating strains in 2000-2001 were influenza A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) and influenza B/Sichuan/379/99. Children had access to CAIV-T during the 1998-1999, 1999-2000, and 2000-2001 influenza seasons. The vaccine included influenza A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2) and B/Beijing/184/93-like (B/Ann Arbor/l/94) strains in all three seasons. The vaccine included A/Beijing/262/95 (H1N1) in 1998-1999 and 1999-2000, which was replaced by A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) in 2000-2001. When medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI) was used as the outcome, the protective effectiveness for children vaccinated in 2000 was 18% (95% confidence interval (CI): 11, 25). Based on a combination of a validation sample of surveillance cultures and the MAARI outcome, protective efficacy against combined influenza A (H1N1) and B was 79% (95% CI: 51, 91). The efficacy estimate, after accounting for missing influenza culture status, against influenza A (H1N1) alone was 92% (95% CI: 42, 99) and against a new variant of influenza B alone was 66% (95% CI: 9, 87). CAIV-T provides substantial protection against a mixture of influenza A (H1N1) and B. Results demonstrate the powerful potential of using validation sets for outcomes in vaccine field studies.},

abstract = {The estimation of transmission parameters has been problematic for diseases that rely predominantly on transmission of pathogens from person to person through small infectious droplets. Age-specific transmission parameters determine how such respiratory agents will spread among different age groups in a human population. Estimating the values of these parameters is essential in planning an effective response to potentially devastating pandemics of smallpox or influenza and in designing control strategies for diseases such as measles or mumps. In this study, the authors estimated age-specific transmission parameters by augmenting infectious disease data with auxiliary data on self-reported numbers of conversational partners per person. They show that models that use transmission parameters based on these self-reported social contacts are better able to capture the observed patterns of infection of endemically circulating mumps, as well as observed patterns of spread of pandemic influenza. The estimated age-specific transmission parameters suggested that school-aged children and young adults will experience the highest incidence of infection and will contribute most to further spread of infections during the initial phase of an emerging respiratory-spread epidemic in a completely susceptible population. These findings have important implications for controlling future outbreaks of novel respiratory-spread infectious agents.},

In this paper, we consider evaluation of the community-level effectiveness measures on the example of vaccination of children against influenza. We introduce the concept of the epidemic prevention potential (EPP) as a measure of the ability of an intervention to either prevent transmission or at least to keep it below a pre-defined limit. As a concept to describe the general ability of an intervention to limit outbreaks to a certain defined size, the term EPP fills a void. We constructed a stochastic simulation model of influenza transmission and vaccination in a structured community to illustrate the effectiveness measures of interest and the epidemic prevention potential. The concepts are general and could be applied to other interventions, such as antivirals and quarantine. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Although most influenza infections are self-limited, few other diseases exert such a huge toll of suffering and economic loss. Despite the importance of influenza, there had been, until recently, little advance in its control since amantadine was licensed almost 40 years ago. During the past decade, evidence has accrued on the protection afforded by inactivated vaccines and the safety and efficacy in children of live influenza-virus vaccines. There have been many new developments in vaccine technology. Moreover, work on viral neuraminidase has led to the licensing of potent selective antiviral drugs, and economic decision modelling provides further justification for annual vaccination and a framework for the use of neuraminidase inhibitors. Progress has also been made on developing near-patient testing for influenza that may assist individual diagnosis or the recognition of widespread virus circulation, and so optimise clinical management. Despite these advances, the occurrence of avian H5N1, H9N2, and H7N7 influenza in human beings and the rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome are reminders of our vulnerability to an emerging pandemic. The contrast between recent cases of H5N1 infection, associated with high mortality, and the typically mild, self-limiting nature of human infections with avian H7N7 and H9N2 influenza shows the gaps in our understanding of molecular correlates of pathogenicity and underlines the need for continuing international research into pandemic influenza. Improvements in animal and human surveillance, new approaches to vaccination, and increasing use of vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat annual influenza outbreaks are essential to reduce the global toll of pandemic and interpandemic influenza.},

abstract = {Following the detection of imported cases of pandemic influenza A(H1N1)v on 25 April 2009, New Zealand implemented containment measures that appeared to slow establishment of the pandemic during May. The pandemic accelerated markedly in June, reaching a peak within four to six weeks, and has been declining since mid-July. By 23 August there had been 3,179 recorded cases (97.8% reported as confirmed), including 972 hospitalisations, 114 intensive care admissions, and 16 deaths. Influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance in general practice suggests that 7.5% (95% CI: 3.4-11.2) of the population of New Zealand had symptomatic infection, giving a case fatality ratio of 0.005%. Hospitalisations were markedly higher for M{\=a}ori (age standardised relative risk (RR)=3.0, 95% CI: 2.9-3.2) and Pacific peoples (RR=6.7, 95% CI: 6.2-7.1) compared with Europeans and others. The apparent decline of the pandemic (shown by all surveillance systems) cannot be fully explained. New Zealand remains in the middle of its traditional influenza season, the influenza A(H1N1)v virus appears relatively infectious, and we estimate that only about 11% of the population have been infected by this novel agent.},

title = {Oseltamivir-resistant 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in two summer campers receiving prophylaxis--North Carolina, 2009},
abstract = {Initial testing of the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus found it susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) and resistant to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine). Neuraminidase inhibitors have been used widely for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1); however, sporadic cases of oseltamivir-resistant 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection have been reported worldwide, including nine U.S. cases identified as of September 4. On July 14, CDC was contacted by a physician at a summer camp in North Carolina regarding two cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) in adolescent girls receiving oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis during an ILI outbreak that had begun June 18. The two girls stayed in the same cabin, and both received oseltamivir during a mass chemoprophylaxis program in which approximately 600 campers and staff members received oseltamivir or zanamivir. On July 20 and July 22, the North Carolina State Laboratory of Public Health confirmed pandemic H1N1 virus infection in respiratory specimens from both girls. On August 14 and August 19, CDC detected the H275Y mutation (N1 numbering) in neuraminidase from both specimens by pyrosequencing. The H275Y mutation is associated with resistance to oseltamivir; zanamivir susceptibility is retained. A second mutation (I223V) in neuraminidase also was detected in both specimens. This is the first report of oseltamivir resistance in pandemic H1N1 cases with an epidemiologic link. Health-care providers should be aware that antiviral resistance can develop during chemoprophylaxis or treatment with subtherapeutic dosages and should follow published recommendations for antiviral medications.},

title = {Zanamivir in the prevention of influenza among healthy adults: a randomized controlled trial},
abstract = {CONTEXT: The neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir, a sialic acid analog administered directly to the respiratory tract, has been demonstrated in clinical studies to be effective in treatment of type A and B influenza. It has also been shown to prevent influenza infection and disease in an experimental model. OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of zanamivir, administered once daily, in the prevention of influenza infection and disease. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Two midwestern university communities. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1107 healthy adults (mean age [range], 29 [18-69] years) were recruited in November 1997, before the influenza season. INTERVENTION: At the start of the influenza outbreak, 554 subjects were randomized to receive placebo and 553 to receive zanamivir. The drug, 10 mg once per day, or identical placebo was administered by oral inhalation for a 4-week period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Illness occurrence was recorded by participants daily and records were evaluated weekly. Specimens were collected for viral isolation when symptoms were reported within 3 days of illness onset. Infection was also identified by testing paired serum samples for rise in antibody titer against the circulating influenza viruses. RESULTS: Zanamivir was 67% efficacious (95% confidence interval [CI], 39%-83%; P<.001) in preventing laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza meeting the case definition and 84% efficacious (95% CI, 55%-94%; P=.001) in preventing laboratory-confirmed illnesses with fever. All influenza infections occurring during the season, with or without symptoms, were prevented with an efficacy of 31% (95% CI, 4%-50%; P=.03). The nature and incidence of adverse events in the zanamivir group did not differ from placebo. Compliance with the once-daily dosage was high. CONCLUSIONS: Zanamivir administered once daily is efficacious and well tolerated in the prevention of influenza for a 4-week period in healthy adults.},

title = {A multi-group model of Schistosoma japonicum transmission dynamics and control: model calibration and control prediction},
abstract = {Previously we formulated a quantitative model to characterize site-specific schistosomiasis transmission. In this paper, we present a procedure to calibrate the model to data collected in endemic villages of south-western Sichuan, China, with the objective of reducing parametric uncertainty to allow the model to describe local transmission with relative confidence. A Bayesian approach using local epidemiological data and expert opinion is employed to calibrate the model. Results indicate that, after calibration, the output uncertainty is reduced substantially. The calibrated model is then used for prediction of the effects of different intervention options. Simulations reflect a bimodal transmission in both human (early summer and early fall) and snail (late summer and late fall) infections in this area, for which there is some field evidence. Also shown in the simulations are relatively high reinfection rates following chemotherapy in these endemic villages. These results suggest that a sustainable control strategy is essential in reducing transmission, and that transmission can be reduced by chemotherapy, focal snail (e.g. snail clusters) control, and egg control. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of characterizing site-specific schistosomiasis transmission using a mathematical model and a calibration approach that integrates diverse field data, and the use of the calibrated model to design control strategies.},

title = {Evolution and adaptation of H5N1 influenza virus in avian and human hosts in Indonesia and Vietnam},
abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 is endemic in poultry in East and Southeast Asia with disease outbreaks recently spreading to parts of central Asia, Europe and Africa. Continued interspecies transmission to humans has been reported in Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia and China, causing pandemic concern. Here, we genetically characterize 82 H5N1 viruses isolated from poultry throughout Indonesia and Vietnam and 11 human isolates from southern Vietnam together with sequence data available in public databases to address questions relevant to virus introduction, endemicity and evolution. Phylogenetic analysis shows that all viruses from Indonesia form a distinct sublineage of H5N1 genotype Z viruses suggesting this outbreak likely originated from a single introduction that spread throughout the country during the past two years. Continued virus activities in Indonesia were attributed to transmission via poultry movement within the country rather than through repeated introductions by bird migration. Within Indonesia and Vietnam, H5N1 viruses have evolved over time into geographically distinct groups within each country. Molecular analysis of the H5N1 genotype Z genome shows that only the M2 and PB1-F2 genes were under positive selection, suggesting that these genes might be involved in adaptation of this virus to new hosts following interspecies transmission. At the amino acid level 12 residues were under positive selection in those genotype Z viruses, in the HA and PB1-F2 proteins. Some of these residues were more frequently observed in human isolates than in avian isolates and are related to viral antigenicity and receptor binding. Our study provides insight into the ongoing evolution of H5N1 influenza viruses that are transmitting in diverse avian species and at the interface between avian and human hosts.},

abstract = {A study of liver and colon cancers and their association with a previous diagnosis of schistosomiasis was performed in rural Sichuan, China. The data analysed came from 127 liver-cancer and 142 colon-cancer patients, each matched, by age, gender, hospital and township, with one or two controls. The cancer cases were identified from the hospital records of three Sichuan counties (all of which have some level of endemic schistosomiasis japonicum): Meishan (66 liver and 54 colon cases), Pujiang (16 liver and 22 colon cases) and Xichang (45 liver and 66 colon cases). Each control was selected using the hospital records for the same year the matched case of cancer was diagnosed, when the control had been found to have an illness other than cancer. Previous schistosomal infection was determined by examining the medical records at the county hospitals, searching the records at the local schistosomiasis-control stations or health-surveillance units, and, when no written record could be found, by interviews with the subjects or their relatives. Given the extremely strong association between hepatitis and liver cancer in China, only data from hepatitis-negative pairs were used in the analyses. Previous schistosomal infection was found to be significantly associated with both liver cancer (odds ratio = 3.7; 95% confidence interval = 1.0-13) and colon cancer (odds ratio = 3.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.8-6.1). The results indicate a fraction of disease attributable to schistosomiasis of 24% for colon cancer, and (among the hepatitis-negative population) one of 27% for liver cancer.},

title = {The impact of local heterogeneity on alternative control strategies for foot-and-mouth disease},
abstract = {The 2001 epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the UK resulted in the death of nearly 10 million livestock at a cost that was estimated to be up to 8 billion pounds. Owing to the controversy surrounding the epidemic, the question of whether or not alternative policies would have resulted in significantly better control of the epidemic remains of great interest. A hexagonal lattice simulation of FMD in Cumbria is used to address the central question of whether or not better use could have been made of expert knowledge of FMD transmission to target pre-emptive culling, by assuming that the premises at greatest risk of becoming infected can be targeted for culling. The 2000 UK census and the epidemiological database collected during the epidemic are used to describe key characteristics of disease transmission, and the model is fit to the epidemic time-series. Under the assumptions of the model, the parameters that best fit the epidemic in Cumbria indicate that a policy based on expert knowledge would have exacerbated the epidemic compared with the policy as implemented. However, targeting more distant, high-risk farms could be more valuable under different epidemic conditions, notably, if risk factors of sufficient magnitude could be identified to aid in prioritizing vaccination or culling of farms at high risk of becoming infected.},

Such measures could potentially provide valuable time for pandemic-strain vaccine and antiviral medication production and distribution. Optimally, appropriate NPI implementation would decrease the burden on healthcare services and critical infrastructure. These public health measures, however, are often associated with enormous social and economic costs. Therefore, it is imperative to assess past applications of NPIs in order to better understand how they might (or might not) be employed during future pandemics in an effective, legal, ethical manner that inspires confidence and compliance in the public at large.},

title = {Mechanisms of broad cross-protection provided by influenza virus infection and their application to vaccines},
abstract = {Mice recovered from influenza A virus infection have been shown to be cross-protected against challenge infection with either drift viruses within a subtype (subtype-specific immunity) or different subtype viruses (heterosubtypic immunity). The mechanisms of broad-spectrum of cross-protection could be explained as follows. (i) Pre-existing S-IgA and IgG antibodies (Abs) induced by infection are involved in the elimination of challenge viruses by forming virus-Ig complexes shortly after re-infection. Due to their polymeric nature, the S-IgA Abs, existing more abundant on the mucosa than are IgG Abs, are strongly cross-reactive with challenge viruses, whereas the IgG Abs are weakly cross-reactive with challenge viruses, due to their monomeric nature. The specificity of Abs is directed mainly at hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. (ii) CD8+ memory T cells induced by infection are involved in the elimination of challenge viruses by the accelerated killing of host cells infected with different subtype viruses from day 3 onwards after re-infection. The specificity of memory T cells is directed against viral internal proteins. (iii) The accelerated IgA and IgG Ab responses, produced by B memory cells after a challenge, are also involved in cross-protection from day 4 onwards after re-infection. (iv) In the epithelial cells of infected mice, dimeric IgA that is trafficked through the epithelial cells can contribute to the prevention of viral assembly by binding to newly synthesized viral proteins. Natural infection is well known to be superior to parenteral inactivated vaccines in inducing the broad-spectrum cross-protection. To improve the efficacy of current inactivated vaccines, many trials have been conducted to mimic natural infection, including intranasal or epidermal administration of inactivated vaccine with or without an adjuvant; such studies are still ongoing. In the near future, some of these trials may provide new, safer and more effective broad-spectrum vaccines than those currently available.},

abstract = {The 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus, which was first identified in the United States and Mexico, was imported into New Zealand by a high school group returning from Mexico in late April 2009. By June, sustained community transmission of the virus had been established in New Zealand. To track the incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) and compare the number of viruses identified as 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) with the number identified as seasonal influenza, New Zealand public health officials analyzed weekly data from the country's sentinel general practitioner (GP) surveillance system and nonsentinel laboratory surveillance network for the period extending from the week ending May 3 through the week ending August 2. This report describes the results of those analyses, which determined that the number of viruses identified as 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) rapidly overtook the number identified as seasonal influenza, and the peak weekly consultation rate for ILI was three times the peak rate in New Zealand during the same period in 2008. These findings demonstrate the value of using integrated epidemiologic and virologic surveillance in New Zealand to monitor the scope of an influenza epidemic, identify circulating strains, assist public health control measures, and guide effective use of influenza vaccines and antivirals.},

This was one of the first times that models had been used during an epidemic to support the decision-making process. It is probable that models will play a pivotal role in any future livestock epidemics, and it is therefore important that decision makers, veterinarians and farmers understand the uses and limitations of models. This review describes the utility of models in general before focusing on the three foot-and-mouth disease models used in 2001. Finally, the future of modelling is discussed, analysing the advances needed if models are to be successfully applied during any subsequent epidemics.},

abstract = {A small proportion of air travelers make disproportionately more journeys than the rest of travelers. They also tend to interact predominantly with other frequent travelers in hotels and airport lounges. This group has the potential to accelerate global spread of infectious respiratory diseases. Using an epidemiologic model, we simulated exportation of cases from severe acute respiratory syndrome-like and influenza-like epidemics in a population for which a small proportion travel more frequently than the rest. Our simulations show that frequent travelers accelerate international spread of epidemics only if they are infected early in an outbreak and the outbreak does not expand rapidly. If the epidemic growth rate is high, as is likely for pandemic influenza, heterogeneities in travel are frequently overwhelmed by the large number of infected persons in the majority population and the resulting high probability that some of these persons will take an international flight.},

abstract = {The occurrence of types A and B influenza infections was determined by isolation and serology over six years among residents of Tecumseh, Michigan. By isolation, there was evidence of type A infection for a limited period during each year of the study; most rises in titer were detected during the periods of viral isolation, but some also occurred out of season. Outbreaks of type B infection were encountered three times during the six-year period and out of season infections were less frequently seen than with type A. Infection rates with type A were relatively flat over the age range, with high rates seen in infants and small children; in contrast, highest infection rates with type B were observed in the 5--14-year-olds. On examination of illness rates, it was found that some of the outbreaks wound have gone undetected if surveillance techniques for infection had not been in operation. Frequency of respiratory illness with activity restriction was taken as a guide to influenza virus activity during outbreaks; it was found that highest rates of such illnesses occurred among the 1--4-year-olds for type A outbreaks, and among the 5--9-year-olds during mixed or type B outbreaks.},

title = {Reducing the impact of the next influenza pandemic using household-based public health interventions},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza in domestic poultry and wild birds has caused global concern over the possible evolution of a novel human strain [1]. If such a strain emerges, and is not controlled at source [2,3], a pandemic is likely to result. Health policy in most countries will then be focused on reducing morbidity and mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimate the expected reduction in primary attack rates for different household-based interventions using a mathematical model of influenza transmission within and between households. We show that, for lower transmissibility strains [2,4], the combination of household-based quarantine, isolation of cases outside the household, and targeted prophylactic use of anti-virals will be highly effective and likely feasible across a range of plausible transmission scenarios. For example, for a basic reproductive number (the average number of people infected by a typically infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population) of 1.8, assuming only 50% compliance, this combination could reduce the infection (symptomatic) attack rate from 74% (49%) to 40% (27%), requiring peak quarantine and isolation levels of 6.2% and 0.8% of the population, respectively, and an overall anti-viral stockpile of 3.9 doses per member of the population. Although contact tracing may be additionally effective, the resources required make it impractical in most scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: National influenza pandemic preparedness plans currently focus on reducing the impact associated with a constant attack rate, rather than on reducing transmission. Our findings suggest that the additional benefits and resource requirements of household-based interventions in reducing average levels of transmission should also be considered, even when expected levels of compliance are only moderate.},

Of the 293 subjects, 14 (4.8%) household contacts met the case definition and most secondary cases were probably infected around the time of symptom onset date of the respective index case. The SAR among household contacts who did not receive prophylaxis was 7.6%, similar to the rate of seasonal influenza, and the attack rate in siblings was significantly higher than that in parents. We conclude that it is important to establish routine infection control measures for households in order to prevent the spread of the virus among household contacts and, possibly, to the community. We could not conclude whether antiviral prophylaxis was effective or not. However, among close contacts with underlying disease who received prophylaxis, nobody developed a severe form of the disease.},

More than 64 per cent of eligibles were vaccinated; this figure resembled that of the rest of the local area, but not the national figures nor a suburban area of Michigan where a similar study was carried out. Sore arm after vaccination was reported most frequently in younger female participants; however, sore arm was accepted as part of the process of vaccination and not considered a reaction by most. Such perceived reactions were not as commonly reported as in the large suburban area. Antibody response to the vaccine was excellent, not only in terms of antibodies to the swine virus itself but also in terms of cross reactive antibodies to the emergent H1N1 (Russian) influenza strain.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We conducted investigations in 2 villages in Cambodia where outbreaks of influenza H5N1 occurred among humans and poultry to determine the frequency of and risk factors for H5N1 virus transmission. METHODS: During May 2006, approximately 7 weeks after outbreaks of influenza H5N1 among poultry occurred, villagers living near households of 2 patients with influenza H5N1 were interviewed about potential H5N1 exposures and had blood samples obtained for H5N1 serological testing by microneutralization assay. A seropositive result was defined as an influenza H5N1 neutralizing antibody titer of 1:80, with confirmation by Western blot assay. A case-control study was conducted to identify risk factors for influenza H5N1 virus infection. Control subjects, who had seronegative results of tests, were matched with H5N1-seropositive persons by village residence, households with an influenza H5N1-infected poultry flock, sex, and age. RESULTS: Seven (1.0%) of 674 villagers tested seropositive for influenza H5N1 antibodies and did not report severe illness; 6 (85.7%) were male. The 7 H5N1-seropositive persons, all of whom were aged<or=18 years, were younger than participants who tested seronegative for H5N1 antibodies (median age, 12.0 years vs. 27.4 years; P=.03) and were more likely than were the 24 control subjects to report bathing or swimming in household ponds (71.4% vs. 20.8%; matched odds ratio, 11.3; P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Avian-to-human transmission of influenza H5N1 virus remains low, despite extensive poultry contact. Exposure to a potentially contaminated environment was a risk factor for human infection.},

abstract = {The rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome demonstrated the potential threat an infectious disease poses in a closely interconnected and interdependent world. Here we introduce a probabilistic model that describes the worldwide spread of infectious diseases and demonstrate that a forecast of the geographical spread of epidemics is indeed possible. This model combines a stochastic local infection dynamics among individuals with stochastic transport in a worldwide network, taking into account national and international civil aviation traffic. Our simulations of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak are in surprisingly good agreement with published case reports. We show that the high degree of predictability is caused by the strong heterogeneity of the network. Our model can be used to predict the worldwide spread of future infectious diseases and to identify endangered regions in advance. The performance of different control strategies is analyzed, and our simulations show that a quick and focused reaction is essential to inhibiting the global spread of epidemics.},

abstract = {The first influenza pandemic of the 21st century, due to a new strain of A(H1N1) virus, was declared on 11 June 2009 by the Director-General of the World Health Organization. Fortunately, the international community, including influenza vaccine manufacturers, has been increasing its preparedness for such an event, triggered by the need to stem the spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus over recent years. Today, the development of a pandemic influenza vaccine in the fastest possible time is a global priority. However, two major issues need to be taken into consideration: how long will it take to produce sufficient pandemic vaccine doses to immunize the global population at risk, including poor populations that have no resources to purchase the vaccine; and how will pandemic vaccine production affect availability of trivalent vaccine for the forthcoming 2009-2010 influenza season. To address these questions, WHO carried out a survey in May 2009 among influenza vaccine manufacturers on their planned seasonal and pandemic production with a view to developing recommendations on the distribution and use of pandemic influenza vaccine.},

Using the Mus musculus-Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma rodhaini host-parasite systems we characterized mate choice and inter-specific competition between these two schistosome species. Simultaneous infections revealed species-specific mate preferences for both species as well as suggesting mating competition, with male S. rodhaini appearing dominant over male S. mansoni. S. rodhaini homologous pairs were also shown to have increased reproduction per paired female in the presence of a competitor in simultaneous infections. Overall total reproductive success was, however, similar between the two species under conditions of direct competition due to the greater initial infectivity of S. mansoni in comparison to S. rodhaini. Inter-specific competition was also implicated as increased parasite virulence to the host. The potential effects of such interactions on parasite and host ecology and evolution in nature are discussed.},

Data from the Tecumseh Community Health Study were used to estimate excess morbidity owing to influenza, and results were compared with estimates made previously using different methodology for an Institute of Medicine report. METHODS. Study participants from Tecumseh, Michigan, were classified as infected or noninfected based on laboratory results. The excess numbers of respiratory illnesses, respiratory illness days, and bed and restricted activity days experienced by the infected compared with the noninfected were estimated. RESULTS. The number of excess influenza-related respiratory illnesses was lower than that estimated in the Institute of Medicine report, in which all illnesses of certain characteristics occurring during an influenza season were attributed to influenza. It is now estimated that the US population under 20 years of age experiences a yearly average of 13.8 to 16.0 million influenza-related excess respiratory illnesses; for older individuals, the yearly estimate is 4.1 to 4.4 million excess illnesses. CONCLUSIONS. For public health purposes, estimates of excess morbidity as well as of total morbidity associated with influenza should be used in setting health priorities.},

This article summarises some of the experience to date and looks towards the expected autumn increases of influenza activity that will affect every country. To date the distribution of transmission has been highly heterogenous between and within countries, with one country the United Kingdom (UK) experiencing the most cases and the highest transmission rates. Most infections are mild but there are steadily increasing numbers of people needing hospital care and more deaths are being reported. An initial difference in practice between Europe and North America was over case-finding and treatment with some authorities in Europe using active case-finding, contact tracing and treatment/prophylaxis with antivirals to try and delay transmission. This article details the history of this practice in the past two months and explains how and why countries are moving to mitigation, especially treating with antivirals those at higher risk of experiencing severe disease.},

The fine grain of the epidemiological data reveals the infection dynamics at an unusually high spatiotemporal resolution. We show that the spatial distribution, size, and species composition of farms all influence the observed pattern and regional variability of outbreaks. The other key dynamical component is long-tailed stochastic dispersal of infection, combining frequent local movements with occasional long jumps. We assess the history and possible duration of the epidemic, the performance of control strategies, and general implications for disease dynamics in space and time.},

abstract = {A protocol was created for performing geographically randomized snail surveys for schistosomiasis research using the global positioning system (GPS). This protocol differs from traditional surveys in its ability to accurately map and measure the spatial distribution of snail habitat. The protocol was used to map irrigation ditches, the primary habitat for Oncomelania hupensis, in two residence areas in Sichuan Province, China. From the 7,450 meters of mapped ditches, snail surveys were performed at 203 random sites along the ditch network. Of these, 116 (57.1%) sites had snails. The total number of living snails captured was 2,014, resulting in an average snail density of 0.27 snails per linear meter of potential habitat.},

title = {Repeated influenza vaccination of healthy children and adults: borrow now, pay later?},
abstract = {A growing number of publications are recommending annual influenza vaccination of healthy children and adults. However, the long-term consequences of repeated influenza vaccination are unknown. We used a simple model of recurrent influenza infection to assess the likely impact of various repeated influenza vaccination scenarios. The model was based on a Markovian framework and was fitted on annual incidence rates of influenza infection by age. We found that natural influenza infection reduced the risk of being re-infected by 15.4% (95% confidence interval 7.1-23.0). Various scenarios of repeated influenza vaccination were then simulated and compared with a reference scenario where vaccination is given from age 65 years onwards. We show that repeated vaccination at a young age substantially increases the risk of influenza in older age, by a factor ranging between 1.2 (vaccination after 50 years) to 2.4 (vaccination from birth). These findings have important implications for influenza vaccination policies.},

abstract = {Schoolchildren regularly have the highest influenza attack rates. Schoolchildren also are accessible for vaccination; school-based vaccine clinics can facilitate delivery of vaccine to a high proportion of children in a short period of time. CAIV-T has advantages for immunization of this group due to the effectiveness of a single dose, ease of administration, and ready acceptance by children. Modeling of control for an influenza epidemic by Longini et al. has shown vaccination of 70% of school children would dampen epidemics and significantly reduce the exposure of vulnerable people in the community. The goal of the central Texas trial is to demonstrate this effect in the field. Universal childhood immunization could be an important supplement to current control efforts. Vaccine coverage with TIV has leveled off since 1997; no progress toward the Healthy People 2010 goals of 90% coverage has been made after 4 years in the new decade. The number of excess deaths is expected to double within the next 25 years if control methods are not intensified. CAIV-T may become an important adjunct to control measures and can facilitate influenza pandemic preparedness.},

title = {H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection during pregnancy in the USA},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus has been identified as the cause of a widespread outbreak of febrile respiratory infection in the USA and worldwide. We summarised cases of infection with pandemic H1N1 virus in pregnant women identified in the USA during the first month of the present outbreak, and deaths associated with this virus during the first 2 months of the outbreak. METHODS: After initial reports of infection in pregnant women, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began systematically collecting additional information about cases and deaths in pregnant women in the USA with pandemic H1N1 virus infection as part of enhanced surveillance. A confirmed case was defined as an acute respiratory illness with laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 virus infection by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR or viral culture; a probable case was defined as a person with an acute febrile respiratory illness who was positive for influenza A, but negative for H1 and H3. We used population estimates derived from the 2007 census data to calculate rates of admission to hospital and illness. FINDINGS: From April 15 to May 18, 2009, 34 confirmed or probable cases of pandemic H1N1 in pregnant women were reported to CDC from 13 states. 11 (32%) women were admitted to hospital. The estimated rate of admission for pandemic H1N1 influenza virus infection in pregnant women during the first month of the outbreak was higher than it was in the general population (0.32 per 100 000 pregnant women, 95% CI 0.13-0.52 vs 0.076 per 100 000 population at risk, 95% CI 0.07-0.09). Between April 15 and June 16, 2009, six deaths in pregnant women were reported to the CDC; all were in women who had developed pneumonia and subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. INTERPRETATION: Pregnant women might be at increased risk for complications from pandemic H1N1 virus infection. These data lend support to the present recommendation to promptly treat pregnant women with H1N1 influenza virus infection with anti-influenza drugs. FUNDING: US CDC.},

The methods, which are based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, are developed in the context of epidemic models. Their use is illustrated for the particular case where only susceptible, infective, and removed states are represented using simulated realizations of the process. By comparing estimated likelihoods with theoretical forms, in cases where these can be derived, or with the known model parameters, we show that the methods can be used to provide meaningful estimates of parameters and parameter uncertainty.

title = {Estimating the impact of school closure on influenza transmission from Sentinel data},
abstract = {The threat posed by the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus requires public health authorities to prepare for a human pandemic. Although pre-pandemic vaccines and antiviral drugs might significantly reduce illness rates, their stockpiling is too expensive to be practical for many countries. Consequently, alternative control strategies, based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, are a potentially attractive policy option. School closure is the measure most often considered. The high social and economic costs of closing schools for months make it an expensive and therefore controversial policy, and the current absence of quantitative data on the role of schools during influenza epidemics means there is little consensus on the probable effectiveness of school closure in reducing the impact of a pandemic. Here, from the joint analysis of surveillance data and holiday timing in France, we quantify the role of schools in influenza epidemics and predict the effect of school closure during a pandemic. We show that holidays lead to a 20-29% reduction in the rate at which influenza is transmitted to children, but that they have no detectable effect on the contact patterns of adults. Holidays prevent 16-18% of seasonal influenza cases (18-21% in children). By extrapolation, we find that prolonged school closure during a pandemic might reduce the cumulative number of cases by 13-17% (18-23% in children) and peak attack rates by up to 39-45% (47-52% in children). The impact of school closure would be reduced if it proved difficult to maintain low contact rates among children for a prolonged period.},

title = {The effect of household distribution on transmission and control of highly infectious diseases},
abstract = {Two epidemic threshold parameters are derived for the spread of a highly infectious disease in a community of households, where a household is any group whose members have frequent contacts with each other. It is assumed that the infection of any member of a household results in the infection of all susceptible members of that household. The threshold parameters have simple expressions in terms of the mean household size and the mean and variance of the number of susceptibles per household. They provide a basic reproduction number R0 for the spread of infection from individual to individual and a basic reproduction number RH0 for the spread of infection from household to household. The threshold parameters are used to derive the levels of immunity required for the prevention of major epidemics in the community. They are also used to evaluate various vaccination strategies having the same vaccination coverage. For a community with households of equal size, it is found that random vaccination of individuals is better than immunizing all members of a corresponding fraction of households. In contrast, when households have varying sizes, immunizing all members of large households can be better than a corresponding vaccination coverage of randomly selected individuals. It is illustrated that these threshold parameters can also be used for a community of households with schools or day care centers. In particular, the effectiveness of immunizing all members of a school is quantified.},

abstract = {In this paper, the authors provide estimates of 4 measures of vaccine efficacy for live, attenuated and inactivated influenza vaccine based on secondary analysis of 5 experimental influenza challenge studies in seronegative adults and community-based vaccine trials. The 4 vaccine efficacy measures are for susceptibility (VE(S)), symptomatic illness given infection (VE(P)), infection and illness (VE(SP)), and infectiousness (VE(I)). The authors also propose a combined (VE(C)) measure of the reduction in transmission in the entire population based on all of the above efficacy measures. Live influenza vaccine and inactivated vaccine provided similar protection against laboratory-confirmed infection (for live vaccine: VE(S) = 41%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 15, 66; for inactivated vaccine: VE(S) = 43%, 95% CI: 8, 79). Live vaccine had a higher efficacy for illness given infection (VE(P) = 67%, 95% CI: 24, 100) than inactivated vaccine (VE(P) = 29%, 95% CI: -19, 76), although the difference was not statistically significant. VE(SP) for the live vaccine was higher than for the inactivated vaccine. VE(I) estimates were particularly low for these influenza vaccines. VE(SP) and VE(C) can remain high for both vaccines, even when VE(I) is relatively low, as long as the other 2 measures of vaccine efficacy are relatively high.},

abstract = {In the Philippines, there is a need to understand the contribution of different domestic and wild animals in transmitting Schistosoma japonicum infection to humans better. The current study describes variation in animal S. japonicum prevalence across 50 endemic villages of Samar Province, the Philippines. A total of 50 villages were selected, 25 with predominantly rain-fed farms and 25 with some irrigation system. At least 35 cats, dogs, pigs, and water buffaloes each were randomly selected and 30 rat traps were set in each village. Fecal samples were collected for up to three consecutive days for each species. The Danish Bilharziasis Laboratory method (DBL method) was used to determine S. japonicum infection status. A hierarchical logistic regression model with clustering by village and with adjustment for measurement error of the DBL method was used to estimate the prevalence of infection per village and species. Stool samples were collected from 23.4% (1189), 28.6% (1274), 36.3% (1899), and 49.4% (873) of the censused dogs, cats, pigs, and water buffaloes, respectively, and from 663 rats. The adjusted prevalence of S. japonicum infection varied greatly across villages ranging from 1.6% (95% Bayesian Credible Interval: 0.1%-10.2%) to 86.3% (65.9%-97.8%) for dogs, from 0.1% (0%-2.1%) to 21.7% (4.7%-51.2%) for cats, from 0.01% (0.0%%-1.0%) to 18.4% (7.1%-34.7%) for pigs, from less than 0.1% (0.0%-1.2%) to 72.5% (46.0%-97.4%) for water buffaloes, and from 0.7% (0.0%-9.0%) to 95.4% (77.2%-99.9%) for rats. This is the most comprehensive study of animal S. japonicum infection conducted to date. Our results show that, unlike what has been reported in China, very few water buffaloes were infected whereas rats and dogs show high prevalence proportions of infection. This, combined with significant village-to-village variation in prevalence of S. japonicum infection, suggest possible different transmission dynamics of the infection in the Province of Samar in the Philippines and China.},

title = {Mixed infection and the genesis of influenza virus diversity},
abstract = {The emergence of viral infections with potentially devastating consequences for human health is highly dependent on their underlying evolutionary dynamics. One likely scenario for an avian influenza virus, such as A/H5N1, to evolve to one capable of human-to-human transmission is through the acquisition of genetic material from the A/H1N1 or A/H3N2 subtypes already circulating in human populations. This would require that viruses of both subtypes coinfect the same cells, generating a mixed infection, and then reassort. Determining the nature and frequency of mixed infection with influenza virus is therefore central to understanding the emergence of pandemic, antigenic, and drug-resistant strains. To better understand the potential for such events, we explored patterns of intrahost genetic diversity in recently circulating strains of human influenza virus. By analyzing multiple viral genome sequences sampled from individual influenza patients we reveal a high level of mixed infection, including diverse lineages of the same influenza virus subtype, drug-resistant and -sensitive strains, those that are likely to differ in antigenicity, and even viruses of different influenza virus types (A and B). These results reveal that individuals can harbor influenza viruses that differ in major phenotypic properties, including those that are antigenically distinct and those that differ in their sensitivity to antiviral agents.},

abstract = {School closure along with mass prophylactic oseltamivir treatment of pupils have been used in England and elsewhere to contain school outbreaks of influenza A(H1N1)v. We evaluated the protective effect, compliance with and side effects of oseltamivir chemoprophylactic treatment with a ten-day course of 1x 75mg given to 11-12-year-old pupils in one school year in a secondary school in South West England closed for ten days in response to a symptomatic laboratory-confirmed pupil. We distributed a questionnaire to pupils in the affected school year in class after the school had re-opened. Questions included symptoms of flu-like illness, compliance with chemoprophylaxis and side effects. All present on the day, 248 (93.2%) participated. Compliance with chemoprophylaxis was high, 77% took the full course, 91% took at least seven days. Fifty-one percent experienced symptoms such as feeling sick (31.2%), headaches (24.3%) and stomach ache (21.1%). Although some children were ill with flu-like symptoms, those tested did not have A(H1N1)v infection. Compliance with oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis was high, although likely side effects were common. The burden of side effects needs to be considered when deciding on mass oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis in children especially given that the symptoms of A(H1N1)v influenza are generally mild.},

title = {The Need for Validation of Statistical Methods for Estimating Respiratory Virus-Attributable Hospitalization},
abstract = {Public policy regarding influenza has been based largely on the burden of hospitalization estimated through ecologic studies applying increasingly sophisticated statistical methods to administrative databases. None are known to have been validated by observational studies. The authors illustrated how 6 commonly applied statistical methods estimate virus-attributable hospitalization of children 6-23 months of age and compared the estimates with results obtained from a prospective study using virologic assessment. The proportions of pneumonia and influenza and of bronchiolitis hospitalizations attributable to respiratory syncytial virus and/or influenza were derived by using Serfling regression, periseason differences, Poisson regression with log link, negative binomial regression with identity link, and a Box-Jenkins transfer function. No method provided accurate or consistent estimates for both viruses and outcomes. Virus-attributable hospitalization estimates varied widely between statistical methods and between seasons, with greater between-season variation for admissions attributed to influenza compared with respiratory syncytial virus. Sophistication of statistical methods may have been interpreted as assurance that results are more accurate. Without validation against epidemiologic data, with viral etiology confirmed in individual patients, the accuracy of statistical methods in ecologic studies is simply not known. Until these methods are validated, their methodological limitations should be made explicit and proxy estimates used cautiously in guiding public policy.},

title = {Effectiveness of movement-prevention regulations to reduce the spread of foot-and-mouth disease in The Netherlands},
abstract = {After the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in 2001 the Dutch government implemented movement-prevention regulations to reduce the number of contacts between farms and consequently the risk of spread of highly contagious animal infections in the future. We studied the efficacy of these regulations by comparing registered cattle-movement data from 2000 to those from 2002. We also used the spatial and stochastic simulation model InterFMD to evaluate the consequences of the observed alterations in cattle-contact structure on the spread and control of a FMD epidemic. There was a significant decrease in the number of cattle movements "for live use", no difference in the number of group movements "for live use" and a distinct change in the overall contact structure. The most important structure changes were a decrease in the number of group movements from dairy farms to cattle-collection centres (-44%), and an increase in the number of group movements from dairy farms to beef farms (111%). Our simulations demonstrated that the implemented regulations result in a concentration of the FMD-affected area and therefore in a reduction in size of the epidemics. Based on the intended Dutch strategy to control future FMD outbreaks, the decrease in extreme epidemics (95th percentiles) went from 31 infected farms in an epidemic-length of 65 days to 8 infected farms in an epidemic-length of 53 days in sparsely populated areas. In densely populated areas this decrease went from 135 infected farms to 103, while the duration reduced from 88 days to 81.},

Preliminary results suggest that if the 1968-1969 pandemic strain returned, it would spread concurrently to cities in both the northern and southern hemispheres thereby exhibiting less of the characteristic seasonal swing. In addition, after recognition of pandemic onset in the focal city, the time lag for public health intervention is very short.

title = {A Bayesian MCMC approach to study transmission of influenza: application to household longitudinal data},
abstract = {We propose a transmission model to estimate the main characteristics of influenza transmission in households. The model details the risks of infection in the household and in the community at the individual scale. Heterogeneity among subjects is investigated considering both individual susceptibility and infectiousness. The model was applied to a data set consisting of the follow-up of influenza symptoms in 334 households during 15 days after an index case visited a general practitioner with virologically confirmed influenza.Estimating the parameters of the transmission model was challenging because a large part of the infectious process was not observed: only the dates when new cases were detected were observed. For each case, the data were augmented with the unobserved dates of the start and the end of the infectious period. The transmission model was included in a 3-levels hierarchical structure: (i) the observation level ensured that the augmented data were consistent with the observed data, (ii) the transmission level described the underlying epidemic process, (iii) the prior level specified the distribution of the parameters. From a Bayesian perspective, the joint posterior distribution of model parameters and augmented data was explored by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.The mean duration of influenza infectious period was estimated at 3.8 days (95 per cent credible interval, 95 per cent CI [3.1,4.6]) with a standard deviation of 2.0 days (95 per cent CI [1.1,2.8]). The instantaneous risk of influenza transmission between an infective and a susceptible within a household was found to decrease with the size of the household, and established at 0.32 person day(-1) (95 per cent CI [0.26,0.39]); the instantaneous risk of infection from the community was 0.0056 day(-1) (95 per cent CI [0.0029,0.0087]). Focusing on the differences in transmission between children (less than 15 years old) and adults, we estimated that the former were more likely to transmit than adults (posterior probability larger than 99 per cent), but that the mean duration of the infectious period was similar in children (3.6 days, 95 per cent CI [2.3,5.2]) and adults (3.9 days, 95 per cent CI [3.2,4.9]). The posterior probability that children had a larger community risk was 76 per cent and the posterior probability that they were more susceptible than adults was 79 per cent.},

We have investigated genetic variation at 8 microsatellite loci of T. b. gambiense strains isolated from human African trypanosomiasis patients in the Ivory Coast and Guinea, with the aim of knowing how genetic information was partitioned within and between individuals in both temporal and spatial scales. The results indicate that (i) migration of T. b. gambiense group 1 strains does not occur at the scale of West Africa, and that even at a finer scale (e.g., within Guinea) migration is restricted; (ii) effective population sizes of trypanosomes, as reflected by infected hosts, are probably higher than what the epidemiological surveys suggest; and (iii) T. b. gambiense group 1 is most likely a strictly clonally reproducing organism.},

abstract = {Antiviral agents are an important component in mitigation/containment strategies for pandemic influenza. However, most research for mitigation/containment strategies relies on the antiviral efficacies evaluated from limited data of clinical trials. Which efficacy measures can be reliably estimated from these studies depends on the trial design, the size of the epidemics, and the statistical methods. We propose a Bayesian framework for modeling the influenza transmission dynamics within households. This Bayesian framework takes into account asymptomatic infections and is able to estimate efficacies with respect to protecting against viral infection, infection with clinical disease, and pathogenicity (the probability of disease given infection). We use the method to reanalyze 2 clinical studies of oseltamivir, an influenza antiviral agent, and compare the results with previous analyses. We found significant prophylactic efficacies in reducing the risk of viral infection and infection with disease but no prophylactic efficacy in reducing pathogenicity. We also found significant therapeutic efficacies in reducing pathogenicity and the risk of infection with disease but no therapeutic efficacy in reducing the risk of viral infection in the contacts.},

title = {Genesis of a highly pathogenic and potentially pandemic H5N1 influenza virus in eastern Asia},
abstract = {A highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, H5N1, caused disease outbreaks in poultry in China and seven other east Asian countries between late 2003 and early 2004; the same virus was fatal to humans in Thailand and Vietnam. Here we demonstrate a series of genetic reassortment events traceable to the precursor of the H5N1 viruses that caused the initial human outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 (refs 2-4) and subsequent avian outbreaks in 2001 and 2002 (refs 5, 6). These events gave rise to a dominant H5N1 genotype (Z) in chickens and ducks that was responsible for the regional outbreak in 2003-04. Our findings indicate that domestic ducks in southern China had a central role in the generation and maintenance of this virus, and that wild birds may have contributed to the increasingly wide spread of the virus in Asia. Our results suggest that H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential have become endemic in the region and are not easily eradicable. These developments pose a threat to public and veterinary health in the region and potentially the world, and suggest that long-term control measures are required.},

title = {Containing pandemic influenza with antiviral agents},
abstract = {For the first wave of pandemic influenza or a bioterrorist influenza attack, antiviral agents would be one of the few options to contain the epidemic in the United States until adequate supplies of vaccine were available. The authors use stochastic epidemic simulations to investigate the effectiveness of targeted antiviral prophylaxis to contain influenza. In this strategy, close contacts of suspected index influenza cases take antiviral agents prophylactically. The authors compare targeted antiviral prophylaxis with vaccination strategies. They model an influenza pandemic or bioterrorist attack for an agent similar to influenza A virus (H2N2) that caused the Asian influenza pandemic of 1957-1958. In the absence of intervention, the model predicts an influenza illness attack rate of 33% of the population (95% confidence interval (CI): 30, 37) and an influenza death rate of 0.58 deaths/1,000 persons (95% Cl: 0.4, 0.8). With the use of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, if 80% of the exposed persons maintained prophylaxis for up to 8 weeks, the epidemic would be contained, and the model predicts a reduction to an illness attack rate of 2% (95% Cl: 0.2, 16) and a death rate of 0.04 deaths/1,000 persons (95% CI: 0.0003, 0.25). Such antiviral prophylaxis is nearly as effective as vaccinating 80% of the population. Vaccinating 80% of the children aged less than 19 years is almost as effective as vaccinating 80% of the population. Targeted antiviral prophylaxis has potential as an effective measure for containing influenza until adequate quantities of vaccine are available.},

title = {The effect of universal influenza immunization on mortality and health care use},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2000, Ontario, Canada, initiated a universal influenza immunization program (UIIP) to provide free influenza vaccines for the entire population aged 6 mo or older. Influenza immunization increased more rapidly in younger age groups in Ontario compared to other Canadian provinces, which all maintained targeted immunization programs. We evaluated the effect of Ontario's UIIP on influenza-associated mortality, hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) use, and visits to doctors' offices. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Mortality and hospitalization data from 1997 to 2004 for all ten Canadian provinces were obtained from national datasets. Physician billing claims for visits to EDs and doctors' offices were obtained from provincial administrative datasets for four provinces with comprehensive data. Since outcomes coded as influenza are known to underestimate the true burden of influenza, we studied more broadly defined conditions. Hospitalizations, ED use, doctors' office visits for pneumonia and influenza, and all-cause mortality from 1997 to 2004 were modelled using Poisson regression, controlling for age, sex, province, influenza surveillance data, and temporal trends, and used to estimate the expected baseline outcome rates in the absence of influenza activity. The primary outcome was then defined as influenza-associated events, or the difference between the observed events and the expected baseline events. Changes in influenza-associated outcome rates before and after UIIP introduction in Ontario were compared to the corresponding changes in other provinces. After UIIP introduction, influenza-associated mortality decreased more in Ontario (relative rate [RR] = 0.26) than in other provinces (RR = 0.43) (ratio of RRs = 0.61, p = 0.002). Similar differences between Ontario and other provinces were observed for influenza-associated hospitalizations (RR = 0.25 versus 0.44, ratio of RRs = 0.58, p < 0.001), ED use (RR = 0.31 versus 0.69, ratio of RRs = 0.45, p < 0.001), and doctors' office visits (RR = 0.21 versus 0.52, ratio of RRs = 0.41, p < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess consistency, specificity, and the presence of a dose-response relationship. Limitations of this study include the ecological study design, the nonspecific outcomes, difficulty in modeling baseline events, data quality and availability, and the inability to control for potentially important confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to targeted programs in other provinces, introduction of universal vaccination in Ontario in 2000 was associated with relative reductions in influenza-associated mortality and health care use. The results of this large-scale natural experiment suggest that universal vaccination may be an effective public health measure for reducing the annual burden of influenza.},

The model illustrates how the sanitary measures postponed the peak of the epidemic and decreased its intensity. It provides quantitative predictions on the effect of relaxing the sanitary measures after a period of control. We show how the sanitary measures reduced the maximal prevalence of the infected population from 10% to less than 6% of the total population. We also show how the model predicts the time of maximal prevalence and explains the effect of the control measures.},

abstract = {Avian influenza infections by high and low pathogenicity H7 influenza viruses have caused several outbreaks in European poultry in recent years, also resulting in human infections. Although in some cases the source of H7 strains from domestic poultry was shown to be the viruses circulating in the wild bird reservoir, a thorough characterization of the entire genome of H7 viruses from both wild and domestic Eurasian birds, and their evolutionary relationships, has not been conducted. In our study, we have analysed low pathogenicity H7 influenza strains isolated from wild and domestic ducks in Italy and southern China and compared them with those from reared terrestrial poultry such as chicken and turkey. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the H7 haemagglutinin genes were all closely related to each other, whereas the remaining genes could be divided into two or more phylogenetic groups. Almost each year different H7 reassortant viruses were identified and in at least two different years more than one H7 genotype co-circulated. A recent precursor in wild waterfowl was identified for most of the gene segments of terrestrial poultry viruses. Our data suggest that reassortment allows avian influenza viruses, in their natural reservoir, to increase their genetic diversity. In turn this might help avian influenza viruses colonize a wider range of hosts, including domestic poultry.},

abstract = {Rapid reaction in the face of an epidemic is a key element in effective and efficient control; this is especially important when the disease has severe public health or economic consequences. Determining an appropriate level of response requires rapid estimation of the rate of spread of infection from limited disease distribution data. Generally, the techniques used to estimate such spatial parameters require detailed spatial data at multiple time points; such data are often time-consuming and expensive to collect. Here we present an alternative approach that is computationally efficient and only requires spatial data from a single time point, hence saving valuable time at the start of the epidemic. By assuming that fundamental spatial statistics are near equilibrium, parameters can be estimated by minimizing the expected rate of change of these statistics, hence conserving the general spatial pattern. Although applicable to both ecological and epidemiological data, here we focus on disease data from computer simulations and real epidemics to show that this method produces reliable results that could be used in practical situations.},

title = {Use of influenza vaccine in non-high risk populations},
abstract = {The aim of most strategies for vaccination against influenza is the prevention of mortality. Since individuals in the high risk group are mainly elderly, and the elderly have a low frequency of influenza infection, this strategy can have no significant controlling effect on morbidity. It has been shown in the longitudinal community study in Tecumseh, Michigan that highest frequency of infection with influenza is seen in the school-age population; this pattern is quite marked for type B influenza and less so for type A. In addition, it was possible in 1968-69 to show that vaccination of schoolchildren with an inactivated H3N2 vaccine resulted in a three-fold reduction in the attack rate for the entire community. Because of a number of problems in use of inactive vaccines, including the need for parenteral administration, it is unlikely that such preparations could be used regularly on this large a scale. However, it would be entirely feasible for live virus vaccines to be employed in such a manner. The use of more extensive vaccination would have an additional beneficial effect, since it has recently been shown in Tecumseh that a relationship may well exist between frequent respiratory infections and the development of chronic bronchitis in apparently healthy individuals.},

title = {Impact of a national helminth control programme on infection and morbidity in Ugandan schoolchildren},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the health impact of a national control programme targeting schistosomiasis and intestinal nematodes in Uganda, which has provided population-based anthelmintic chemotherapy since 2003. METHODS: We conducted longitudinal surveys on infection status, haemoglobin concentration and clinical morbidity in 1871 randomly selected schoolchildren from 37 schools in eight districts across Uganda at three time points - before chemotherapy and after one year and two years of annual mass chemotherapy. FINDINGS: Mass treatment with praziquantel and albendazole led to a significant decrease in the intensity of Schistosoma mansoni - 70% (95% confidence interval (CI): 66-73%) after one year and 82% (95% CI: 80-85%) after two years of treatment. Intensity of hookworm infection also decreased (75% and 93%; unadjusted). There was a significant increase in haemoglobin concentration after one (0.135 g/dL (95% CI: 0.126-0.144)) and two years (0.303 g/dL (95% CI: 0.293-0.312)) of treatment, and a significant decrease in signs of early clinical morbidity. The impact of intervention on S. mansoni prevalence and intensity was similar to that predicted by mathematical models of the impact of chemotherapy on human schistosomiasis. Improvements in haemoglobin concentration were greatest among children who were anaemic or harbouring heavy S. mansoni infection at baseline. CONCLUSION: Anthelmintic treatment delivered as part of a national helminth control programme can decrease infection and morbidity among schoolchildren and improve haemoglobin concentration.},

title = {The generation of influenza outbreaks by a network of host immune responses against a limited set of antigenic types},
abstract = {It is commonly believed that influenza epidemics arise through the incremental accumulation of viral mutations, culminating in a novel antigenic type that is able to escape host immunity. Successive epidemic strains therefore become increasingly antigenically distant from a founding strain. Here, we present an alternative explanation where, because of functional constraints on the defining epitopes, the virus population is characterized by a limited set of antigenic types, all of which may be continuously generated by mutation from preexisting strains and other processes. Under these circumstances, influenza outbreaks arise as a consequence of host immune selection in a manner that is independent of the mode and tempo of viral mutation. By contrast with existing paradigms, antigenic distance between epidemic strains does not necessarily accumulate with time in our model, and it is the changing profile of host population immunity that creates the conditions for the emergence of the next influenza strain rather than the mutational capabilities of the virus.},

title = {The impact of the demographic transition on dengue in Thailand: insights from a statistical analysis and mathematical modeling},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increase in the average age of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases has been reported in Thailand. The cause of this increase is not known. Possible explanations include a reduction in transmission due to declining mosquito populations, declining contact between human and mosquito, and changes in reporting. We propose that a demographic shift toward lower birth and death rates has reduced dengue transmission and lengthened the interval between large epidemics. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using data from each of the 72 provinces of Thailand, we looked for associations between force of infection (a measure of hazard, defined as the rate per capita at which susceptible individuals become infected) and demographic and climactic variables. We estimated the force of infection from the age distribution of cases from 1985 to 2005. We find that the force of infection has declined by 2% each year since a peak in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Contrary to recent findings suggesting that the incidence of DHF has increased in Thailand, we find a small but statistically significant decline in DHF incidence since 1985 in a majority of provinces. The strongest predictor of the change in force of infection and the mean force of infection is the median age of the population. Using mathematical simulations of dengue transmission we show that a reduced birth rate and a shift in the population's age structure can explain the shift in the age distribution of cases, reduction of the force of infection, and increase in the periodicity of multiannual oscillations of DHF incidence in the absence of other changes. CONCLUSIONS: Lower birth and death rates decrease the flow of susceptible individuals into the population and increase the longevity of immune individuals. The increase in the proportion of the population that is immune increases the likelihood that an infectious mosquito will feed on an immune individual, reducing the force of infection. Though the force of infection has decreased by half, we find that the critical vaccination fraction has not changed significantly, declining from an average of 85% to 80%. Clinical guidelines should consider the impact of continued increases in the age of dengue cases in Thailand. Countries in the region lagging behind Thailand in the demographic transition may experience the same increase as their population ages. The impact of demographic changes on the force of infection has been hypothesized for other diseases, but, to our knowledge, this is the first observation of this phenomenon.

abstract = {Tracking novel influenza viruses which have the potential to cause pandemics, such as the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, is a public health priority. Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was first identified in Mexico in April 2009 and spread world-wide over a short period of time. Well-validated diagnostic tools that are rapid, sensitive, and specific for detection and tracking of this virus are needed. Three real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were developed for the amplification and detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus and their performance was compared with other published diagnostic assays. Thirty-nine pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus confirmed positive samples from Alberta, Canada and six additional samples that were positive for influenza A, but were not typeable using published seasonal influenza H1/H3 assays were available for this validation. Amplification and direct sequencing of products was considered the gold standard for case identification. The new assays were sensitive and able to reproducibly detect virus in a 10(-6) dilution of 4 x 10(6) TCID50/ml using 5microL as template. They showed 100% specificity and did not cross-react with other respiratory viruses or seasonal influenza A sub-types. The coefficient of variation in crossing threshold values for detection of different template concentrations of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was </=3.13%, showing good reproducibility. The assays had a wide dynamic range for the detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus and utilized testing platforms appropriate for high diagnostic throughput with rapid turn-around-time. We developed and validated these real-time PCR procedures with the goal that they will be useful for diagnosis and surveillance of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, this will contribute to informed management of the novel virus.},

title = {Age and secular distributions of virus-proven influenza patients in successive epidemics 1961-1976 in Cirencester: epidemiological significance discussed},
abstract = {A general practice population of around 3900, under continuous clinical and laboratory surveillance, experienced 20 outbreaks of influenza between March 1960 and March 1976. Four epidemics were caused by subtype H2N2 type A viruses, seven by subtype H3N2 type A viruses and nine outbreaks by type B viruses. The age of every person proved virologically to have influenza is related to the age structure of the community and to the phase of the epidemic in which the virus-positive specimens were collected. Children 0-15 years old suffered a higher incidence rate than adults 16-90+. Pre-school children 0-4 suffered the highest rate of infection by viruses of both influenza A subtypes, whereas older schoolchildren 10-15 suffered the highest rate of type B infections. Despite these high incidence rates neither pre-school nor schoolchildren appear to have been the major disseminators of any of these influenza viruses in the community. Adults of all ages suffered a high rate of infection even into extreme old age, and the indiscriminate age distribution among adults was sustained in the successive epidemics. Such age-patterns are not those caused by a highly infectious immunizing virus surviving by means of direct transmissions from the sick, whose prompt development of the disease continues endless chains of transmissions. An alternative epidemic mechanism--whereby the virus does not spread from the sick but becomes latent in them, reactivating seasonally so that they later infect their companions--would produce age patterns similar to those recorded here for influenza patients. The suggested mechanism is illustrated by a simple conceptual model and the influenzal age patterns are discussed in relation to the recycling of influenza A subtypes.},

title = {Identification of the progenitors of Indonesian and Vietnamese avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses from southern China},
abstract = {The transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus to Southeast Asian countries triggered the first major outbreak and transmission wave in late 2003, accelerating the pandemic threat to the world. Due to the lack of influenza surveillance prior to these outbreaks, the genetic diversity and the transmission pathways of H5N1 viruses from this period remain undefined. To determine the possible source of the wave 1 H5N1 viruses, we recently conducted further sequencing and analysis of samples collected in live-poultry markets from Guangdong, Hunan, and Yunnan in southern China from 2001 to 2004. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of 73 H5N1 isolates from this period revealed a greater genetic diversity in southern China than previously reported. Moreover, results show that eight viruses isolated from Yunnan in 2002 and 2003 were most closely related to the clade 1 virus sublineage from Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, while two viruses from Hunan in 2002 and 2003 were most closely related to viruses from Indonesia (clade 2.1). Further phylogenetic analyses of the six internal genes showed that all 10 of those viruses maintained similar phylogenetic relationships as the surface genes. The 10 progenitor viruses were genotype Z and shared high similarity (>/=99%) with their corresponding descendant viruses in most gene segments. These results suggest a direct transmission link for H5N1 viruses between Yunnan and Vietnam and also between Hunan and Indonesia during 2002 and 2003. Poultry trade may be responsible for virus introduction to Vietnam, while the transmission route from Hunan to Indonesia remains unclear.},

InterSpread Plus was parameterised to simulate epidemics of FMD in the population of farms containing susceptible animal species in the Korean counties of Yongin, Icheon, Pyongtaek, Anseong, Eumseong, Asan, Cheonan, and Jincheon. The starting point of our analyses was the simulation of a reference strategy, which approximated the real epidemic. The results of simulations of alternative epidemic-control strategies were compared with this reference strategy. Ring vaccination (when used with either limited or extended pre-emptive depopulation) reduced both the size and variability of the predicted number of infected farms. Reducing the time between disease incursion and commencement of controls had the greatest effect on reducing the predicted number of infected farms.},

title = {Origins and evolutionary genomics of the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 influenza A epidemic},
abstract = {In March and early April 2009, a new swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) emerged in Mexico and the United States. During the first few weeks of surveillance, the virus spread worldwide to 30 countries (as of May 11) by human-to-human transmission, causing the World Health Organization to raise its pandemic alert to level 5 of 6. This virus has the potential to develop into the first influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century. Here we use evolutionary analysis to estimate the timescale of the origins and the early development of the S-OIV epidemic. We show that it was derived from several viruses circulating in swine, and that the initial transmission to humans occurred several months before recognition of the outbreak. A phylogenetic estimate of the gaps in genetic surveillance indicates a long period of unsampled ancestry before the S-OIV outbreak, suggesting that the reassortment of swine lineages may have occurred years before emergence in humans, and that the multiple genetic ancestry of S-OIV is not indicative of an artificial origin. Furthermore, the unsampled history of the epidemic means that the nature and location of the genetically closest swine viruses reveal little about the immediate origin of the epidemic, despite the fact that we included a panel of closely related and previously unpublished swine influenza isolates. Our results highlight the need for systematic surveillance of influenza in swine, and provide evidence that the mixing of new genetic elements in swine can result in the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential in humans.},

abstract = {Geographical separation of host species has shaped the avian influenza A virus gene pool into independently evolving Eurasian and American lineages, although phylogenetic evidence for gene flow and reassortment indicates that these lineages also mix on occasion. While the evolutionary dynamics of the avian influenza gene pool have been described, the consequences of gene flow on virus evolution and population structure in this system have not been investigated. Here we show that viral gene flow from Eurasia has led to the replacement of endemic avian influenza viruses in North America, likely through competition for susceptible hosts. This competition is characterized by changes in rates of nucleotide substitution and selection pressures. However, the discontinuous distribution of susceptible hosts may produce long periods of co-circulation of competing virus strains before lineage extinction occurs. These results also suggest that viral competition for host resources may be an important mechanism in disease emergence.},

abstract = {The Longini-Koopman model (1982, Biometrics 38, 115-126) describes the process underlying the transmission of an infectious disease in terms of household and community level transmission probabilities. This model is generalized by allowing for different transmission probabilities that may correspond to various levels of risk factors on both the household and community levels. Two types of models are considered: (i) models for household data, where the numbers of susceptible and infected members in each household are known along with the values of household level risk factors; and (ii) models for individual data, where the infection status and risk factor level are known for each individual in the household. Although the type (i) models can be expressed as special cases of the type (ii) models, they deserve special attention as they can be represented and analyzed as log-linear models. Both types of models can be analyzed using maximum likelihood methods, while the type (i) models, when expressed as log-linear models, can also be analyzed by the weighted least squares method. Data from influenza epidemics in Tecumseh, Michigan and Seattle, Washington are used to illustrate these methods.},

title = {A comparative evaluation of modelling strategies for the effect of treatment and host interactions on the spread of drug resistance},
abstract = {The evolutionary responses of infectious pathogens often have ruinous consequences for the control of disease spread in the population. Drug resistance is a well-documented instance that is generally driven by the selective pressure of drugs on both the replication of the pathogen within hosts and its transmission between hosts. Management of drug resistance therefore requires the development of treatment strategies that can impede the emergence and spread of resistance in the population. This study evaluates various treatment strategies for influenza infection as a case study by comparing the long-term epidemiological outcomes predicted by deterministic and stochastic versions of a homogeneously mixing (mean-field) model and those predicted by a heterogeneous model that incorporates spatial pair-wise correlation. We discuss the importance of three major parameters in our evaluation: the basic reproduction number, the population level of treatment, and the degree of clustering as a key parameter determining the structure of heterogeneous interactions. The results show that, as a common feature in all models, high treatment levels during the early stages of disease outset can result in large resistant outbreaks, with the possibility of a second wave of infection appearing in the pair-approximation model. Our simulations demonstrate that, if the basic reproduction number exceeds a threshold value, the population-wide spread of the resistant pathogen emerges more rapidly in the pair-approximation model with significantly lower treatment levels than in the homogeneous models. We tested an antiviral strategy that delays the onset of aggressive treatment for a certain amount of time after the onset of the outbreak. The findings indicate that the overall disease incidence is reduced as the degree of clustering increases, and a longer delay should be considered for implementing the large-scale treatment.},

title = {Vaccinating to protect a vulnerable subpopulation},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemic influenza causes serious mortality and morbidity in temperate countries each winter. Research suggests that schoolchildren are critical in the spread of influenza virus, while the elderly and the very young are most vulnerable to the disease. Under these conditions, it is unclear how best to focus prevention efforts in order to protect the population. Here we investigate the question of how to protect a population against a disease when one group is particularly effective at spreading disease and another group is more vulnerable to the effects of the disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a simple mathematical model of an epidemic that includes assortative mixing between groups of hosts. We evaluate the impact of different vaccine allocation strategies across a wide range of parameter values. With this model we demonstrate that the optimal vaccination strategy is extremely sensitive to the assortativity of population mixing, as well as to the reproductive number of the disease in each group. Small differences in parameter values can change the best vaccination strategy from one focused on the most vulnerable individuals to one focused on the most transmissive individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Given the limited amount of information about relevant parameters, we suggest that changes in vaccination strategy, while potentially promising, should be approached with caution. In particular, we find that, while switching vaccine to more active groups may protect vulnerable groups in many cases, switching too much vaccine, or switching vaccine under slightly different conditions, may lead to large increases in disease in the vulnerable group. This outcome is more likely when vaccine limitation is stringent, when mixing is highly structured, or when transmission levels are high.},

title = {Evaluation of vaccines for H5N1 influenza virus in ferrets reveals the potential for protective single-shot immunization},
abstract = {As part of influenza pandemic preparedness, policy decisions need to be made about how best to utilize vaccines once they are manufactured. Since H5N1 avian influenza virus has the potential to initiate the next human pandemic, isolates of this subtype have been used for the production and testing of prepandemic vaccines. Clinical trials of such vaccines indicate that two injections of preparations containing adjuvant will be required to induce protective immunity. However, this is a working assumption based on classical serological measures only. Examined here are the dose of viral hemagglutinin (HA) and the number of inoculations required for two different H5N1 vaccines to achieve protection in ferrets after lethal H5N1 challenge. Ferrets inoculated twice with 30 microg of A/Vietnam/1194/2004 HA vaccine with AlPO4, or with doses as low as 3.8 microg of HA with Iscomatrix (ISCOMATRIX, referred to as Iscomatrix herein, is a registered trademark of CSL Limited) adjuvant, were completely protected against death and disease after H5N1 challenge, and the protection lasted at least 15 months. Cross-clade protection was also observed with both vaccines. Significantly, complete protection against death could be achieved with only a single inoculation of H5N1 vaccine containing as little as 15 microg of HA with AlPO4 or 3.8 microg of HA with Iscomatrix adjuvant. Ferrets vaccinated with the single-injection Iscomatrix vaccines showed fewer clinical manifestations of infection than those given AlPO4 vaccines and remained highly active. Our data provide the first indication that in the event of a future influenza pandemic, effective mass vaccination may be achievable with a low-dose "single-shot" vaccine and provide not only increased survival but also significant reduction in disease severity.},

title = {Results of epidemic simulation modeling to evaluate strategies to control an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess estimated effectiveness of control and eradication procedures for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in a region of California. SAMPLE POPULATION: 2,238 herds and 5 sale yards in Fresno, Kings, andTulare counties of California. PROCEDURE: A spatial stochastic model was used to simulate hypothetical epidemics of FMD for specified control scenarios that included a baseline eradication strategy mandated by USDA and supplemental control strategies of slaughter or vaccination of all animals within a specified distance of infected herds, slaughter of only high-risk animals identified by use of a model simulation, and expansion of infected and surveillance zones. RESULTS: Median number of herds affected varied from 1 to 385 (17% of all herds), depending on type of index herd and delay in diagnosis of FMD. Percentage of herds infected decreased from that of the baseline eradication strategy by expanding the designated infected area from 10 to 20 km (48%), vaccinating within a 50-km radius of an infected herd (41%), slaughtering the 10 highest-risk herds for each infected herd (39%), and slaughtering all animals within 5 km of an infected herd (24%). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results for the model provided a means of assessing the relative merits of potential strategies for control and eradication of FMD should it enter the US livestock population. For the study region, preemptive slaughter of highest-risk herds and vaccination of all animals within a specified distance of an infected herd consistently decreased size and duration of an epidemic, compared with the baseline eradication strategy.},

title = {A geographic information and remote sensing based model for prediction of Oncomelania hupensis habitats in the Poyang Lake area, China},
abstract = {A model was developed using remote sensing and geographic information system technologies for habitat identification of Oncomelania hupensis, the intermediate host snail of Schistosoma japonicum, in the Poyang Lake area, China. In a first step, two multi-temporal Landsat TM 5 satellite images, one from the wet and the second from the dry season, were visually classified into different land-use types. Next, the normalized difference vegetation index was extracted from the images and the tasseled-cap transformation was employed to derive the wetness feature. Our model predicted an estimated 709 km2 of the marshlands in Poyang Lake as potential habitats for O. hupensis. Near-ground temperature measurements in April and August yielded a range of 22.8-24.2 degrees C, and pH values of 6.0-8.5 were derived from existing records. Both climatic features represent suitable breeding conditions for the snails. Preliminary validation of the model at 10 sites around Poyang Lake revealed an excellent accuracy for predicting the presence of O. hupensis. We used the predicted snail habitats as centroids and established buffer zones around them. Villages with an overall prevalence of S. japonicum below 3% were located more than 1200m away from the centroids. Furthermore, a gradient of high-to-low prevalence was observed with increasing distance from the centroids. In conclusion, the model holds promise for identifying high risk areas of schistosomiasis japonica and may become an important tool for the ongoing national schistosomiasis control programme. The model is of particular relevance for schistosome-affected regions that lack accurate surveillance capabilities and are large enough to be detected at most commercially available remote sensing scales.},

abstract = {We investigate the transmission dynamics of a certain type of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus under experimental conditions. Previous analyses of experimental data from FMD outbreaks in non-homogeneously mixing populations of sheep have suggested a decline in viraemic level through serial passage of the virus, but these do not take into account possible variation in the length of the chain of viral transmission for each animal, which is implicit in the non-observed transmission process. We consider a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed non-Markovian compartmental model for partially observed epidemic processes, and we employ powerful methodology (Markov chain Monte Carlo) for statistical inference, to address epidemiological issues under a Bayesian framework that accounts for all available information and associated uncertainty in a coherent approach. The analysis allows us to investigate the posterior distribution of the hidden transmission history of the epidemic, and thus to determine the effect of the length of the infection chain on the recorded viraemic levels, based on the posterior distribution of a p-value. Parameter estimates of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease are also obtained. The results reveal a possible decline in viraemia in one of the two experimental outbreaks. Our model also suggests that individual infectivity is related to the level of viraemia.},

title = {Are ducks contributing to the endemicity of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in Asia?},
abstract = {Wild waterfowl are the natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses, and these viruses are usually nonpathogenic in these birds. However, since late 2002, H5N1 outbreaks in Asia have resulted in mortality among waterfowl in recreational parks, domestic flocks, and wild migratory birds. The evolutionary stasis between influenza virus and its natural host may have been disrupted, prompting us to ask whether waterfowl are resistant to H5N1 influenza virus disease and whether they can still act as a reservoir for these viruses. To better understand the biology of H5N1 viruses in ducks and attempt to answer this question, we inoculated juvenile mallards with 23 different H5N1 influenza viruses isolated in Asia between 2003 and 2004. All virus isolates replicated efficiently in inoculated ducks, and 22 were transmitted to susceptible contacts. Viruses replicated to higher levels in the trachea than in the cloaca of both inoculated and contact birds, suggesting that the digestive tract is not the main site of H5N1 influenza virus replication in ducks and that the fecal-oral route may no longer be the main transmission path. The virus isolates' pathogenicities varied from completely nonpathogenic to highly lethal and were positively correlated with tracheal virus titers. Nevertheless, the eight virus isolates that were nonpathogenic in ducks replicated and transmitted efficiently to na{\"\i}ve contacts, suggesting that highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses causing minimal signs of disease in ducks can propagate silently and efficiently among domestic and wild ducks in Asia and that they represent a serious threat to human and veterinary public health.},

title = {A cluster of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Information on the clinical features of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) will be of value to physicians caring for patients suspected of having this disorder. METHODS: We abstracted data on the clinical presentation and course of disease in 10 epidemiologically linked Chinese patients (5 men and 5 women 38 to 72 years old) in whom SARS was diagnosed between February 22, 2003, and March 22, 2003, at our hospitals in Hong Kong, China. RESULTS: Exposure between the source patient and subsequent patients ranged from minimal to that between patient and health care provider. The incubation period ranged from 2 to 11 days. All patients presented with fever (temperature, >38 degrees C for over 24 hours), and most presented with rigor, dry cough, dyspnea, malaise, headache, and hypoxemia. Physical examination of the chest revealed crackles and percussion dullness. Lymphopenia was observed in nine patients, and most patients had mildly elevated aminotransferase levels but normal serum creatinine levels. Serial chest radiographs showed progressive air-space disease. Two patients died of progressive respiratory failure; histologic analysis of their lungs showed diffuse alveolar damage. There was no evidence of infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or Legionella pneumophila. All patients received corticosteroid and ribavirin therapy a mean (+/-SD) of 9.6+/-5.42 days after the onset of symptoms, and eight were treated earlier with a combination of beta-lactams and macrolide for 4+/-1.9 days, with no clinical or radiologic efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: SARS appears to be infectious in origin. Fever followed by rapidly progressive respiratory compromise is the key complex of signs and symptoms from which the syndrome derives its name. The microbiologic origins of SARS remain unclear.},

title = {Use of the oral neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir in experimental human influenza: randomized controlled trials for prevention and treatment},
abstract = {CONTEXT: Influenza virus neuraminidase is thought to be essential for virus replication in humans; however, to date, available neuraminidase inhibitors are limited to zanamivir, which is topically administered. OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of oral neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (GS4104/Ro64-0796) for prevention and the early treatment of influenza in experimentally infected humans. DESIGN: Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials conducted between June and July 1997. SETTING: Individual hotel rooms; 2 large US university medical schools. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 117 healthy adult volunteers (aged 18-40 years; median age, 21 years) who were susceptible (hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer < or =1:8). INTERVENTIONS: All subjects were inoculated intranasally with influenza A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1) virus. For the prophylaxis study, oral oseltamivir (100 mg once daily [n = 12], 100 mg twice daily [n = 12], or matching placebo [n = 13], starting 26 hours before virus inoculation) was administered. For the treatment study, the same drug was given (20 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg twice daily, 200 mg once daily, or matching placebo [n = 16], in each group starting 28 hours after inoculation). All regimens were continued for 5 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparing placebo groups with pooled treatment groups, for prophylaxis, outcomes included frequency of infection and viral shedding; for treatment, viral shedding in titers. RESULTS: In the prophylaxis study, 8 (67%) of 12 placebo and 8 (38%) of 21 oseltamivir recipients became infected (P = .16; efficacy, 61%); 6 (50%) placebo compared with 0 oseltamivir recipients shed virus (P<.001; efficacy, 100%), and 33% of placebo but no oseltamivir recipient had infection-related respiratory illness (P<.01). Among infected subjects in the treatment study (n = 69), the viral titer area under the curve of the combined oseltamivir groups (n = 56) was lower (median [interquartile range [IQR]], 80 [23-151] vs 273 [79-306] log10 tissue culture-infective doses50 per milliliter x hour; P = .02) than the placebo group (n = 13), and the median (IQR) duration of viral shedding with therapy was reduced from 107 (83-131) to 58 (35-59) hours (P = .003). Oseltamivir treatment also reduced symptom scores (median [IQR] score-hours, 225 [97-349] vs 400 [189-645]; P = .05), and nasal proinflammatory cytokine levels. Transient mild to moderate nausea after dosing was observed in 15 (17%) of 88 oseltamivir and 2 (7%) of 29 placebo recipients (95% confidence interval for difference, -11% to 68%), which was largely prevented by ingestion with food. CONCLUSIONS: In these trials, prophylaxis and early treatment with oral oseltamivir were both associated with significant antiviral and clinical effects in experimental human influenza.},

title = {Influenza pandemic preparedness in France: modelling the impact of interventions},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza pandemics result in excess mortality and social disruption. To assist health authorities update the French pandemic plan, the authors estimated the number of health events (cases, hospitalisations, and deaths) in a pandemic and compared interventions in terms of impact and efficiency. Method: A Monte Carlo simulation model, incorporating probability distributions of key variables, provided estimates of health events (HE) by age and risk group. Input variables were set after literature and expert consultation. The impact of targeted influenza vaccination and antiviral prophylaxis/treatment (oseltamivir) in high risk groups (elderly, chronic diseases), priority (essential professionals), and total populations was compared. Outcome measures were HE avoided, number of doses needed, and direct cost per HE avoided. RESULTS: Without intervention, an influenza pandemic could result in 14.9 million cases, 0.12 million deaths, and 0.6 million hospitalisations in France. Twenty four per cent of deaths and 40% of hospitalisations would be among high risk groups. With a 25% attack rate, 2000-86,000 deaths could be avoided, depending on population targeted and intervention. If available initially, vaccination of the total population is preferred. If not, for priority populations, seasonal prophylaxis seems the best strategy. For high risk groups, antiviral treatment, although less effective, seems more feasible and cost effective than prophylaxis (respectively 29% deaths avoided; 1800 doses/death avoided and 56% deaths avoided; 18,500 doses/death avoided) and should be chosen, especially if limited drug availability. CONCLUSION: The results suggest a strong role for antivirals in an influenza pandemic. While this model can compare the impact of different intervention strategies, there remains uncertainty surrounding key variables.},

title = {[Supporting Material] How generation intervals shape the relationship between growth rates and reproductive numbers},
abstract = {Mathematical models of transmission have become invaluable management tools in planning for the control of emerging infectious diseases. A key variable in such models is the reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection. Here, we show that these different equations differ only with respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, we obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate. Furthermore, we show that by taking the generation interval distribution equal to the observed distribution, it is possible to obtain an empirical estimate of the reproductive number.},

title = {Use of cumulative incidence of novel influenza A/H1N1 in foreign travelers to estimate lower bounds on cumulative incidence in Mexico},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: An accurate estimate of the total number of cases and severity of illness of an emerging infectious disease is required both to define the burden of the epidemic and to determine the severity of disease. When a novel pathogen first appears, affected individuals with severe symptoms are more likely to be diagnosed. Accordingly, the total number of cases will be underestimated and disease severity overestimated. This problem is manifest in the current epidemic of novel influenza A/H1N1. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a simple approach to leverage measures of incident influenza A/H1N1 among a relatively small and well observed group of US, UK, Spanish and Canadian travelers who had visited Mexico to estimate the incidence among a much larger and less well surveyed population of Mexican residents. We estimate that a minimum of 113,000 to 375,000 cases of novel influenza A/H1N1 have occurred in Mexicans during the month of April, 2009. Such an estimate serves as a lower bound because it does not account for underreporting of cases in travelers or for nonrandom mixing between Mexican residents and visitors, which together could increase the estimates by more than an order of magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: We find that the number of cases in Mexican residents may exceed the number of confirmed cases by two to three orders of magnitude. While the extent of disease spread is greater than previously appreciated, our estimate suggests that severe disease is uncommon since the total number of cases is likely to be much larger than those of confirmed cases.},

title = {Population dynamics of rapid fixation in cytotoxic T lymphocyte escape mutants of influenza A},
abstract = {The dynamics of cellular immunity against pathogens, and its interaction with the human MHC system, is a key area for empirical research, both within individual hosts and in population genetic surveys. However, in contrast with humoral immunity, the dynamics of cellular immunity have not been modeled at the population level. Here, we address this lacuna with a model of recently observed dramatic invasions of cytotoxic T lymphocyte escape mutants in human influenza A. In particular, we offer an explanation for the rapid fixation of a HLA-B27 restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte escape mutant on the nucleoprotein that emerged in the 1993-1994 season. We find that the dynamics within a single season of influenza do not provide a realistic description, but a model of the full annual dynamics can offer a possible explanation. Our model is deterministic for the winter epidemic, and stochastic for the summer period. An escape mutant that leads to a slightly longer infection in a small proportion of hosts has a substantial advantage through summer persistence. Furthermore, if a small number of founding cases are responsible for initiating each epidemic, then this effect of rapid mutant fixation is amplified.},

abstract = {We have recently shown how the outbreaks of measles virus infection in small isolated island communities exhibit an organised pattern in the distribution of epidemic sizes and distribution of epidemic durations. More conventional epidemiological analysis tends not to be useful in such highly intermittent dynamical regimes where there is frequent fade-out of infection. In this paper we discuss how our approach can be applied to an analysis of measles epidemics in highly vaccinated communities where susceptibles build up due to lack of vaccine uptake and also because of occasional vaccine failure.},

title = {Estimating individual and household reproduction numbers in an emerging epidemic},
abstract = {Reproduction numbers, defined as averages of the number of people infected by a typical case, play a central role in tracking infectious disease outbreaks. The aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak. I present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number, which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time, and discuss some potential benefits. Then, to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics, I analyse a model of transmission within and between households, and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number, defined as the number of households infected by each infected household. This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data, and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses. I argue that the household reproduction number is useful in assessing the impact of measures that target the household for isolation, quarantine, vaccination or prophylactic treatment, and measures such as social distancing and school or workplace closures which limit between-household transmission, all of which play a key role in current thinking on future infectious disease mitigation.},

title = {Comparison of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and hemagglutination inhibition in a seroepidemiological study of influenza type C infection},
abstract = {An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed for the detection of antibodies to influenza type C. Based on replicate testing it was decided that an increase of more than three times the standard error of the mean from one serum specimen to the next represented a significant increase in antibody content. After removal of potentially chicken egg albumin antibodies, the test appeared to be more sensitive for the detection of rises in antibody levels than was hemagglutination inhibition. In some cases, heat treatment of the serum before use in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay increased the readings. The strains C/AA/1/59 and C/NJ/1/76 were used in a pilot epidemiological study of influenza C infection in Tecumseh, Mich. Sera tested were collected from autumn of 1976 to autumn of 1978. The overall incidence rate for influenza C infection in the 2-year period was 7.8%. Most cases occurred in children aged 5 to 9 years, and the rates decreased rapidly with increasing age. There appeared to be no relationship to influenza C infection with influenza A or B coinfection. All 17 influenza C infections observed occurred during the 1976 to 1977 respiratory disease season. This indicates that type C virus may not occur endemically, but may exhibit year-to-year variation in infection frequency, as is the case with types A and B.},

abstract = {Influenza vaccination is vital for reducing infection-mediated morbidity and mortality. To maximize effectiveness, vaccination programs must anticipate the effects of public perceptions and attitudes on voluntary adherence. A vaccine allocation strategy that is optimal for the population is not necessarily optimal for an individual. For epidemic influenza, the elderly have the greatest risk of influenza mortality, yet children are responsible for most of the transmission. The long-standing recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control follow the dictates of individual self-interest and prioritize the elderly for vaccination. However, preferentially vaccinating children may dramatically reduce community-wide influenza transmission. A potential obstacle to this is that the personal utility of vaccination is lower for children than it is for the elderly. We parameterize an epidemiological game-theoretic model of influenza vaccination with questionnaire data on actual perceptions of influenza and its vaccine to compare Nash equilibria vaccination strategies driven by self-interest with utilitarian strategies for both epidemic and pandemic influenza. Our results reveal possible strategies to bring Nash and utilitarian vaccination levels into alignment.},

abstract = {For the next influenza season (winter 2009-10) the relative contributions to virus circulation and influenza-associated morbidity of the seasonal influenza viruses A(H3N2), A(H1N1) and B, and the new influenza A(H1N1)v are still unknown. We estimated the chances of seasonal influenza to circulate during the upcoming season using data of the German influenza sentinel scheme from 1992 to 2009. We calculated type and subtype-specific indices for past exposure and the corresponding morbidity indices for each season. For the upcoming season 2009-10 our model suggests that it is unlikely that influenza A(H3N2) will circulate with more than a low intensity, seasonal A(H1N1) with more than a low to moderate intensity, and influenza B with more than a low to median intensity. The probability of a competitive circulation of seasonal influenza A with the new A(H1N1)v is low, increasing the chance for the latter to dominate the next influenza season in Germany.},

The average number of secondary transmissions involving minors (those under 20 years of age) traced back to infected minors is estimated at 2.8. That is, minors can sustain transmission even in the absence of adults. Estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt moved below 1 by 17 May. Active surveillance and public health interventions, including school closures most likely have contributed to keeping Rt below one.},

Abdominal and urinary tract ultrasonography was performed on 2,247 and 2,822 school children, respectively, from 29 randomly selected schools in Mali before the implementation of mass anthelminthic drug administration. Using two-level logistic regression models, we examined associations of potential factors with the risk of having a positive ultrasound global score (morbidity indicative of S. haematobium infection), abnormal image pattern scores, dilatation of the portal vein, and/or enlarged liver (morbidity indicative of S. mansoni infection). The WHO protocol was found useful for detection of S. haematobium pathology but overestimated the risk of portal vein dilatation and left liver lobe enlargement associated with S. mansoni infection. We conclude that ultrasonography should be included in large-scale control interventions, where logistics allow, but cautiously.},

abstract = {Field experiments were conducted in southwestern China to estimate the distances over which cercariae of Schistosoma japonicum are transported and remain infective in village irrigation ditches and to determine the feasibility of interrupting this transport using niclosamide, the molluscicide commonly used for snail control in this environment. The number of worms recovered from bioassay mice downstream from experimentally introduced cercariae, but without niclosamide, decreased about 90% over the first 100 m of ditch and then remained essentially constant for the remaining 300 m of the ditch that was monitored. The niclosamide experiments resulted first in the finding that it was possible to achieve ditch average concentrations close to the target values of 0.25 ppm, but that concentrations at any particular location varied by a factor of up to 3. There was no correlation between water turbidity and niclosamide concentration. An average water concentration of 0.29 ppm resulted in no viable cercariae after a contact time of about 1 min and a travel distance of only 10 m. We regard these results as proof of the feasibility of chemical interruption of transport of S. japonicum cercariae although the toxicity of niclosamide to fish at the levels used here make it a questionable candidate for routine use.},

Cases apparently occurred independently in at least five different municipalities; early case-patients were more likely than later patients to report living near a produce market (odds ratio undefined; lower 95% confidence interval 2.39) but not near a farm; and 9 (39%) of 23 early patients, including 6 who lived or worked in Foshan, were food handlers with probable animal contact.},

abstract = {Better preparedness for an influenza pandemic mitigates its impact. Many countries have started developing and implementing national influenza pandemic preparedness plans. However, the level of preparedness varies among countries. Developing countries encounter unique and difficult issues and challenges in preparing for a pandemic. Deaths attributable to an influenza pandemic could be substantially higher in developing countries than in industrialized countries. Pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines and antiviral agents are less likely to be available in developing countries. The public health and clinical infrastructure of developing countries are often inadequate to deal with a widespread health crisis such as an influenza pandemic. Such an event will inevitably have a global effect. Therefore, improving pandemic preparedness in every country, particularly developing ones, is urgently needed.},

abstract = {The potential relationship between Schistosoma mansoni and anemia was examined using data obtained by the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) before (baseline) and 1 year after (follow-up) a chemotherapeutic treatment program in Uganda. Changes in hemoglobin (Hb) levels in 2,788 children in relation to their schistosomiasis and/or hookworm infection intensity category and baseline anemia status were analyzed. At baseline, significant predictors of childhood anemia were intensities of S. mansoni and hookworm infection. At follow-up, moderate or heavy hookworm as well as heavy S. mansoni infections were important. Children heavily infected with S. mansoni or hookworm had significantly lower Hb counts at baseline compared with those not infected. Among anemic children at the baseline survey, a significant increase in Hb counts of 0.834 g/dL after treatment was found. Our results suggest that anemia is associated with schistosomiasis and hookworm in Ugandan children and that such anemia shows a significant improvement after chemotherapy.},

title = {Strategies for Pandemic and Seasonal Influenza Vaccination of Schoolchildren in the United States},
abstract = {Vaccinating school-aged children against influenza can reduce age-specific and population-level illness attack rates. Using a stochastic simulation model of influenza transmission, the authors assessed strategies for vaccinating children in the United States, varying the vaccine type, coverage level, and reproductive number R (average number of secondary cases produced by a typical primary case). Results indicated that vaccinating children can substantially reduce population-level illness attack rates over a wide range of scenarios. The greatest absolute reduction in influenza illness cases per season occurred at R values ranging from 1.2 to 1.6 for a given vaccine coverage level. The indirect, total, and overall effects of vaccinating children were strong when transmission intensity was low to intermediate. The indirect effects declined rapidly as transmission intensity increased. In a mild influenza season (R = 1.1), approximately 19 million influenza cases could be prevented by vaccinating 70% of children. At most, nearly 100 million cases of influenza illness could be prevented, depending on the proportion of children vaccinated and the transmission intensity. Given the current worldwide threat of novel influenza A (H1N1), with an estimated R of 1.4-1.6, health officials should consider strategies for vaccinating children against novel influenza A (H1N1) as well as seasonal influenza.},

title = {Establishment of influenza A virus (H6N1) in minor poultry species in southern China},
abstract = {An H6N1 virus, A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/97 (W312), was isolated during the "bird flu" incident in Hong Kong in 1997. Genetic analysis suggested that this virus might be the progenitor of the A/Hong Kong/156/97 (HK/97) H5N1 virus, as seven of eight gene segments of those viruses had a common source. Continuing surveillance in Hong Kong showed that a W312-like virus was prevalent in quail and pheasants in 1999; however, the further development of H6N1 viruses has not been investigated since 2001. Here we report influenza virus surveillance data collected in southern China from 2000 to 2005 that show that H6N1 viruses have become established and endemic in minor poultry species and replicate mainly in the respiratory tract. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all H6N1 isolates had W312-like hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. However, reassortment of internal genes between different subtype virus lineages, including H5N1, H9N2, and other avian viruses, generated multiple novel H6N1 genotypes in different types of poultry. These novel H6N1/N2 viruses are double, triple, or even quadruple reassortants. Reassortment between a W312-like H6N1 virus and an A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (HK/97)-like H9N2 virus simultaneously generated novel H6N2 subtype viruses that were persistent in poultry. Molecular analyses suggest that W312-like viruses may not be the precursors of HK/97 virus but reassortants from an HK/97-like virus and another unidentified H6 subtype virus. These results provide further evidence of the pivotal role of the live poultry market system of southern China in generating increased genetic diversity in influenza viruses in this region.},

title = {Immunological serotype interactions and their effect on the epidemiological pattern of dengue},
abstract = {Long-term epidemiological data reveal multi-annual fluctuations in the incidence of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever, as well as complex cyclical behaviour in the dynamics of the four serotypes of the dengue virus. It has previously been proposed that these patterns are due to the phenomenon of the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) among dengue serotypes, whereby viral replication is increased during secondary infection with a heterologous serotype; however, recent studies have implied that this positive reinforcement cannot account for the temporal patterns of dengue and that some form of cross-immunity or external forcing is necessary. Here, we show that ADE alone can produce the observed periodicities and desynchronized oscillations of individual serotypes if its effects are decomposed into its two possible manifestations: enhancement of susceptibility to secondary infections and increased transmissibility from individuals suffering from secondary infections. This decomposition not only lowers the level of enhancement necessary for realistic disease patterns but also reduces the risk of stochastic extinction. Furthermore, our analyses reveal a time-lagged correlation between serotype dynamics and disease incidence rates, which could have important implications for understanding the irregular pattern of dengue epidemics.},

abstract = {A benefit-cost analysis of vaccination for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) was conducted in an area of South Sudan, which due to chronic conflict, had been subject to large-scale humanitarian assistance for many years. The study used participatory epidemiology (PE) methods to estimate the prevalence and mortality of acute and chronic FMD in different age groups of cattle, and the reduction in milk off-take in cows affected by FMD. The benefit-cost of FMD vaccination was 11.5. Losses due to the chronic form of FMD accounted for 28.2% of total FMD losses, indicating that future benefit-cost analyses for FMD control in pastoral and agropastoral areas of Africa need to consider losses caused by chronic disease. Participatory epidemiological methods were also used to assess the importance of milk in the diet of Nuer agropastoralists, and seasonal variations in diet in relation to cattle movements and FMD outbreaks. Marked seasonal variation in diet included a 'hunger gap' period during which households were highly dependent on milk as their main source of food. Outbreaks of FMD occurred immediately before this period of milk dependency, with chronic losses extending through this period and affecting human food security. The paper discusses the need and feasibility of mass vaccination and strategic vaccination for FMD in South Sudan. The paper also discusses the value of combining conventional benefit-cost analysis with livelihoods analysis to inform disease control efforts and funding commitments in humanitarian contexts.},

title = {Estimating variability in the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome to household contacts in Hong Kong, China},
abstract = {The extensive data collection and contact tracing that occurred during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong, China, allowed the authors to examine how the probability of transmission varied from the date of symptom onset to the date of hospitalization for household contacts of SARS patients. Using a discrete-time likelihood model, the authors estimated the transmission probability per contact for each day following the onset of symptoms. The results suggested that there may be two peaks in the probability of SARS transmission, the first occurring around day 2 after symptom onset and the second occurring approximately 10 days after symptom onset. Index patients who were aged 60 years or older or whose lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated upon admission to the hospital (indicating higher viral loads) were more likely to transmit SARS to their contacts. There was little variation in the daily transmission probabilities before versus after the introduction of public health interventions on or around March 26, 2003. This study suggests that the probability of transmission of SARS is dependent upon characteristics of the index patients and does not simply reflect temporal variability in the viral load of SARS cases.},

title = {School closure may be effective in reducing transmission of respiratory viruses in the community},
abstract = {Proposed measures to contain pandemic influenza include school closure, although the effectiveness of this has not been investigated. We examined the effect of a nationwide elementary school strike in Israel in 2000 on the incidence of influenza-like illness. In this historical observational study of 1.7 million members of a preferred provider organization, we analysed diagnoses from primary-care visits during the winter months in 1998-2002. We calculated the weekly ratio of influenza-like diagnoses to non-respiratory diagnoses, and fitted regression models for school-aged children, children's household members, and all other individuals aged >12 years. For each population the steepest drop in the ratio of influenza-like diagnoses to non-respiratory diagnoses occurred in the strike year 2 weeks after the start of the strike. The changes in the weekly ratio of influenza-like diagnoses to non-respiratory diagnoses were statistically significant (P=0.0074) for school children for the strike year compared to other years. A smaller decrease was also seen for the adults with no school-aged children in 1999 (P=0.037). The Chanukah holiday had a negative impact on the ratio for school-aged children in 1998, 1999 and 2001 (P=0.008, 0.006 and 0.045, respectively) and was statistically significant for both adult groups in 1999 and for adults with no school-aged children in 2001. School closure should be considered part of the containment strategy in an influenza pandemic.},

title = {Two-year impact of single praziquantel treatment on infection in the national control programme on schistosomiasis in Burkina Faso},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact on schistosomiasis of biennial treatment with praziquantel (PZQ) among school-age children in Burkina Faso, the first country that achieved full national coverage with treatment of more than 90% of the school-age population. METHODS: A cohort of 1727 schoolchildren (6-14 years old) was monitored at yearly intervals through a longitudinal survey. Additional groups of schoolchildren were monitored in cross-sectional surveys. Parasitological examinations for Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni were performed, and prevalence and intensity of infection before and after treatment were analysed. FINDINGS: Data from the longitudinal cohort show that a single round of PZQ treatment significantly reduced prevalence of S. haematobium infection by 87% (from 59.6% to 7.7%) and intensity of infection by 92.8% (from 94.2 to 6.8 eggs/10 ml of urine) 2 years post-treatment. The impact on infection was also confirmed by a cross-sectional survey 2 years post-treatment. Importantly, the proportion of school-age children with heavy S. haematobium infection decreased from around 25% before treatment to around 2-3% 2 years post-treatment. Cross-sectional comparison of S. haematobium infection in 7-year-old children in their first year at school, who received treatment through community-based drug delivery, also showed significant reduction in both prevalence (65.9%) and intensity of S. haematobium infection (78.4%) 2 years after single treatment. A significant reduction in S. mansoni infection was also achieved. CONCLUSION: Significant and sustained reduction in S. haematobium infection was achieved by biennial treatment in school-age children in Burkina Faso. This may provide a cost-effective treatment strategy for similar national schistosomiasis control programmes in sub-Saharan Africa.},

title = {An endemic model with variable re-infection rate and applications to influenza},
abstract = {An epidemic model is considered, where immunity is not absolute, but individuals that have recovered from the disease can be re-infected at a rate which depends on the time that has passed since their recovery (recovery age). Such a model, e.g., can account for the genetic drift in the influenza virus. In the special case that the model has no vital dynamics, there is no obvious disease-free equilibrium and so the model lacks the usual interplay between the basic replacement ratio being >1 and the disease-free equilibrium being unstable. In fact, this relatively simple model which combines ordinary differential equations with a transport equation shares with general structured population models the feature that the appropriate state space of the solution semiflow is a space of measures, here on the compactified right real half line, with the weak* topology. The disease-free equilibrium, in terms of recovered individuals, is then represented as a Dirac measure concentrated at infinity. Still it is difficult to linearize about it. This makes the concept of persistence very important, for one can show the following: if the basic replacement ratio is > 1, the disease is uniformly strongly persistent, i.e., the number of infectives is ultimately bounded away from 0 with the bound not depending on the initial data. We also derive various conditions for the local and global stability of the endemic equilibrium in terms of the re-infection rate. For instance, the endemic equilibrium is likely to be locally asymptotically stable if the re-infection rate is a highly sub-homogeneous function of recovery age. Conversely, if the re-infection rate is a step function which is zero at small recovery age, the endemic equilibrium can be unstable. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Using a model parametrized with survey-based contact data and mortality data from influenza pandemics, we determined optimal vaccine allocation for five outcome measures: deaths, infections, years of life lost, contingent valuation, and economic costs. We find that optimal vaccination is achieved by prioritization of schoolchildren and adults aged 30 to 39 years. Schoolchildren are most responsible for transmission, and their parents serve as bridges to the rest of the population. Our results indicate that consideration of age-specific transmission dynamics is paramount to the optimal allocation of influenza vaccines. We also found that previous and new recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both for the novel swine-origin influenza and, particularly, for seasonal influenza, are suboptimal for all outcome measures.},

title = {Estimating household and community transmission parameters for influenza},
abstract = {A maximum likelihood procedure is given for estimating household and community transmission parameters from observed influenza infection data. The estimator for the household transmission probability is an improvement over the classical secondary attack rate calculations because it factors out community-acquired infections from true secondary infections. The mathematical model used does not require the specification of infection onset times and, therefore, can be used with serologic data which detect asymptomatic infections. Infection data were derived by serology and virus isolation from the Tecumseh Respiratory Illness Study and the Seattle Flu Study for the years 1975-1979. Included were seasons of influenza B and influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2. The transmission characteristics of influenza B and influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) outbreaks during this period are compared. Influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and influenza B are found to be in descending order both in terms of ease of spread in the household and intensity of the epidemic in the community. Children are found to be the main introducers of influenza into households. the degree of estimation error from the misclassification of infected and susceptible individuals is illustrated with a stochastic simulation model. This model simulates the expected number of detected infections at different levels of sensitivity and specificity for the serologic tests used. Other sources of estimation error, such as deviation from the model assumption of uniform community exposure and the possible presence of superspreaders, are also discussed.},

abstract = {Schistosoma japonicum causes a chronic parasitic disease, which persists as a major public health concern in The Philippines, the People's Republic of China and Indonesia. This infection is unique among helminthic zoonoses because it can infect humans and more than 40 other mammals. The objective of this study was to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the Danish Bilharziasis Laboratory technique in cats, dogs, pigs, water buffaloes and rats in the Philippines. Faecal samples from each animal were collected on up to five occasions on five consecutive days in four villages of Sorsogon and Western Samar Provinces between January and July 2003. The faecal samples were analysed with the filtration and sedimentation Danish Bilharziasis Laboratory technique. Sensitivity and specificity of one, two, three, four, and five faecal samples were estimated using a Bayesian latent class approach. A total of 59, 43, 74, and 80% of the censored cats, dogs, pigs, and water buffaloes in the four villages were sampled, respectively. For all species, the sensitivity estimates when using the results of only 1 day of sampling were less than 80%. However, the sensitivity improved to at least 96% in all species when three or more faecal samples were collected on three separate days. The specificity was estimated to be above 92% across all species, even if just a single sample is used. The prevalences and 95% credible intervals of S. japonicum, adjusted for imperfect sensitivity and specificity, in cats, dogs, pigs, rats, and water buffaloes were 11.9% (6.8-18.3%), 19.9% (15.1-25.2%), 2.9% (1.1-5.2%), 31.3% (18.3-45.6%) and 6.3% (2.1-12.6%), respectively. Our results suggest that the Danish Bilharziasis Laboratory technique is valid for the detection of infection with S. japonicum in animals, and that sensitivity estimates are excellent when faecal samples are collected on at least three different days. Monitoring S. japonicum infection in animal reservoirs with a valid test could contribute to more effective public health control programmes.},

abstract = {The occurrence of influenza was followed in Tecumseh, Michigan during the five year period 1976-1981 by identifying onset of acute respiratory illness and by virus isolation and serology. Type B outbreaks were observed in 1976-1977 and 1979-1980, type A (H3N2) in 1977-1978 and 1980-1981, and type A (H1N1) viruses in 1977-1978, 1978-1979, and 1980-1981. Evidence of low level circulation of viruses in the year preceding an outbreak was not obtained. Age-specific isolation rates from specimens collected by the community physicians differed from age-specific isolation rates from specimens collected from the surveillance, suggesting the operation of a selection mechanism in the former. Symptoms associated with virus isolation were strongly influenced by age. Within age groups, several variables, especially median duration, indicated type A (H3N2) had produced the most severe illnesses, type A (H1N1) the mildest, with type B intermediate. Age-specific infection rates determined by serology for the 1976-1977 and 1977-1978 influenza seasons confirmed the consistently high rates for type A (H3N2) in children with some fall-off with increasing age. Type A (H1N1) rates peaked in children aged 5-19 years and type B in children aged 5-14 years. This may be related in part to insensitivity of the hemagglutination inhibition test in those under age 5 years. Infection with type A (H1N1) was detected at low frequency in adults. Pathogenicity was calculated based on the serologic data. It was estimated for all ages combined that, at a minimum, type A (H3N2) infection produced febrile illness in 25% of cases and type B infection produced respiratory illness in 34% of cases.},

abstract = {Rapid diagnosis of influenza can facilitate timely clinical management. We evaluated the performance of the QuickVue Influenza A + B test (Quidel, San Diego, CA) in a community setting and investigated the factors affecting test sensitivity. We recruited 1008 subjects from 30 outpatient clinics in Hong Kong between February and September 2007. Each subject provided 2 pooled pairs of nose and throat swabs; 1 pair was tested by the QuickVue rapid test on site, and the other pair was sent to a laboratory for reference tests. Among 998 enrolled subjects with valid results, the rapid test had overall sensitivity of 0.68 and specificity of 0.96 compared with viral culture. Sensitivity for both influenza A and B was significantly higher for specimens with viral loads greater than 5 log(10) copies/mL. The QuickVue Influenza A + B test has similar sensitivity in point-of-care community settings to more controlled conditions.},

title = {Descriptive analysis of critical care units in the United States: patient characteristics and intensive care unit utilization},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To gather data about occupancy, admission characteristics, patients' ages, and types of therapy utilized in ICUs in the United States. DESIGN AND SETTING: Survey instruments were mailed to the administrators of 4,233 hospitals to gather information from the medical director of the institutions' respective ICUs for the purpose of developing a database on ICUs in the United States. The sampling frame for this study was based on all American Hospital Association (AHA) hospitals stating they had ICUs. MEASUREMENTS: Census questionnaires solicited information on occupancy, where the patients were admitted from, length of stay, therapies rendered, intensive care diagnoses, and resuscitation status, as well as other information. MAIN RESULTS: Data were obtained regarding 32,850 ICU beds, with 25,871 patients from 2,876 separate ICUs in 1,706 hospitals in the United States. The census response rate was 40% of the AHA hospitals that stated they had ICUs, with specific ICU data on 38.7% of the nation's ICUs. Overall, the responding units reported a mean occupancy rate of 84% of total bed capacity and 87% of available beds. As hospital size increased, so did ICU occupancy. Nearly 17% of all of the critical care patients had been in the units for > 14 days. More precisely, 49% of all responding units indicated that they had one or more "chronic" (> 14-day length of stay) patients. Most patients were admitted to the units from the emergency room (38%), operating room/postanesthesia care unit (22%), and the general hospital floor (16%). Neonatal units were exceptions to this observation, where most patients came from the delivery room (60%). Admission from other hospitals represented a significantly larger group of patients in the cardiac care, pediatric, and neonatal units. Respondents indicated that many of their current patients were elderly, with 43% of these patients aged 65 to 84 yrs and with 4% being > or = 85 yrs of age. The 47% of patients > or = 65 yrs of age increased to 58% when the neonatal and pediatric units were eliminated from the analyses. For all units responding to the survey, the leading primary admitting intensive care diagnoses were postoperative management, ischemic heart disorder, respiratory insufficiency/failure, and prematurity. Elimination of units predominantly treating children (pediatric and neonatal) from the analysis left "adult" units with three primary admitting diagnoses: ischemic heart disease, postoperative management, and respiratory insufficiency/failure with variation according to specific unit type. The leading diagnoses in pediatric units were respiratory insufficiency/failure, postoperative management, and congenital abnormalities. For neonatal units, prematurity was the primary admitting diagnosis, accounting for 59% of these units' patients. Respondents reported 5.3 +/- 10.9% of patients had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) before admission into the critical care unit. Only 6.0 +/- 11.9% of patients in these critical care units had instructions that CPR not be performed while in the unit. CONCLUSIONS: This report should be viewed as the beginning step of an effort to improve both the information base available on critical care medicine and the performance of ICUs. Our survey findings provide an introduction into the everyday workings of critical care units throughout the United States. Research is required to determine which patients will benefit from intensive care and how to efficiently utilize the vast technology we have available for them in a world with limited financial resources, an aging population, and a multiplicity of societal and ethical concerns.},

title = {Field Performance of an Influenza Rapid Diagnostic Test in an Ambulatory Setting},
abstract = {Background: Provided adequate test characteristics, point of care rapid antigen detection tests for influenza could improve the timeliness and appropriateness of clinical decisions. Our objective was to estimate the field sensitivity and specificity of the Quidel QuickVue Influenza A+B Test(TM) in an ambulatory setting. Methods: The sensitivity and specificity of the Quidel QuickVue was evaluated against reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal specimens collected over two consecutive influenza seasons from ambulatory patients consulting for influenza-like illness within 7 days of ILI onset. Results: A total of 491 patients (180 in 2006-2007 and 311 in 2007-2008) with ILI provided specimens tested both with PCR and the Quidel QuickVue. Among the 267 patients positive by PCR (55%), 52 were also positive by QuickVue for an overall sensitivity of 19.5% (CI 95% 14.7%-24.2%). Among the 221 PCR-negative patients, 2 were positive for Influenza B by the rapid test (< 1%), for an overall specificity of 99.1% (CI 95% 97.9-100%). The field sensitivity of the test varied little with the age or gender of the patient, immunization status, delay since onset of symptoms or with influenza season. The sensitivity was slightly but non-significantly higher for influenza B (23%) versus influenza A (18%). Conclusion: Despite its high specificity, the low sensitivity of the Quidel QuickVue Influenza A+B Test(TM) is too poor to direct clinical decisions among ambulatory patients with ILI. Negative results cannot rule out the diagnosis of influenza, and in that context, this test is of questionable utility for routine application in the clinical setting.},

title = {Vaccination with ALVAC and AIDSVAX to Prevent HIV-1 Infection in Thailand},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of a safe and effective vaccine against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is critical to pandemic control. METHODS: In a community-based, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy trial, we evaluated four priming injections of a recombinant canarypox vector vaccine (ALVAC-HIV [vCP1521]) plus two booster injections of a recombinant glycoprotein 120 subunit vaccine (AIDSVAX B/E). The vaccine and placebo injections were administered to 16,402 healthy men and women between the ages of 18 and 30 years in Rayong and Chon Buri provinces in Thailand. The volunteers, primarily at heterosexual risk for HIV infection, were monitored for the coprimary end points: HIV-1 infection and early HIV-1 viremia, at the end of the 6-month vaccination series and every 6 months thereafter for 3 years. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analysis involving 16,402 subjects, there was a trend toward the prevention of HIV-1 infection among the vaccine recipients, with a vaccine efficacy of 26.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], -4.0 to 47.9; P=0.08). In the per-protocol analysis involving 12,542 subjects, the vaccine efficacy was 26.2% (95% CI, -13.3 to 51.9; P=0.16). In the modified intention-to-treat analysis involving 16,395 subjects (with the exclusion of 7 subjects who were found to have had HIV-1 infection at baseline), the vaccine efficacy was 31.2% (95% CI, 1.1 to 52.1; P=0.04). Vaccination did not affect the degree of viremia or the CD4+ T-cell count in subjects in whom HIV-1 infection was subsequently diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: This ALVAC-HIV and AIDSVAX B/E vaccine regimen may reduce the risk of HIV infection in a community-based population with largely heterosexual risk. Vaccination did not affect the viral load or CD4+ count in subjects with HIV infection. Although the results show only a modest benefit, they offer insight for future research.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Heterosexual transmission has long been considered the predominant route of transmission of HIV-1 in sub-Saharan Africa. However, some have argued that unsafe medical injections account for the majority of transmission in this region. GOAL: The goal of this study was to compare the HIV-1 epidemics associated with different transmission routes. STUDY: An age-structured deterministic compartmental model of HIV-1 transmission through both sexual contact and unsafe injections was developed and simulations of sexual transmission and iatrogenic transmission were compared with observed prevalence. RESULTS: Iatrogenic transmission probabilities and numbers of unsafe injections required to generate observed prevalence are unfeasibly high. Simulations of sexually transmitted HIV-1 generate observed prevalence using transmission probabilities and average partner change rates that are within plausible bounds. CONCLUSIONS: Heterosexual transmission seems a more likely route of transmission in the region. However, heterogeneity in contact patterns is of key importance. Further information on groups who are likely to receive more injections is required.},

abstract = {In the Netherlands, influenza specific antivirals are used for the therapy of influenza in nursing homes and hospitals, for prophylaxis in high risk groups and neuraminidase inhibitors are stockpiled as part of pandemic preparedness plans. To monitor the antiviral susceptibility profile, human influenza virus isolates derived from the Dutch influenza surveillance in 2005-2006 (n=87), 2006-2007 (n=58) and 2007-2008 (n=128) were analyzed with phenotypic assays and sequencing. For adamantanes, a high proportion (>74%) of A(H3N2) viruses had the S31N mutation in M2 protein, while variation in the HA(1) region of adamantane-sensitive viruses suggested that adamantane-sensitive variants were reseeded into the Dutch population and re-emerged as drug-sensitive due to M-segment reassortment. For neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, 98% of types A and B influenza viruses prior to 2007-2008 were sensitive for both, whereas 24% of the A(H1N1) viruses obtained in 2007-2008 were oseltamivir-resistant while retaining sensitivity to zanamivir and adamantanes. Furthermore, oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) or adamantane-resistant A(H3N2) virus infections were not associated with differences in clinical symptoms compared to infections with sensitive variants. Our data show the dynamic nature of emergence of drug-resistant influenza viruses, stressing the need for surveillance of resistance trends as part of influenza monitoring programs.},

abstract = {Background. Information on the onset of epidemics of acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) is useful in timing preventive strategies (eg, the passive immunization of high-risk infants against respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]). Aiming at better predictions of the seasonal activity of ARI pathogens, we investigated the influence of climate on hospitalizations for ARIs. Methods. Samples obtained from 3044 children hospitalized with ARIs in Mainz, Germany, were tested for pathogens with a multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from 2001 through 2006. Hospitalizations for ARIs were correlated with meteorological parameters recorded at the University of Mainz. The frequency of hospitalization for RSV infection was predicted on the basis of multiple time series analysis. Results. Influenza A, RSV, and adenovirus were correlated with temperature and rhinovirus to relative humidity. In a time series model that included seasonal and climatic conditions, RSV-associated hospitalizations were predictable. Conclusions. Seasonality of certain ARI pathogens can be explained by meteorological influences. The model presented herein is a first step toward predicting annual RSV epidemics using weather forecast data.},

During May 1-August 20, 2009, medical examiners and local and state health departments submitted specimens to CDC from 77 U.S. patients with fatal cases of confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1). This report summarizes the demographic and clinical findings from these cases and the laboratory evaluation of the specimens. Evidence of concurrent bacterial infection was found in specimens from 22 (29%) of the 77 patients, including 10 caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Duration of illness was available for 17 of the 22 patients; median duration was 6 days (range: 1-25 days). Fourteen of 18 patients for whom information was available sought medical care while ill, and eight (44%) were hospitalized. These findings confirm that bacterial lung infections are occurring among patients with fatal cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) and underscore both the importance of pneumococcal vaccination for persons at increased risk for pneumococcal pneumonia and the need for early recognition of bacterial pneumonia in persons with influenza.},

title = {Non-pharmaceutical public health interventions for pandemic influenza: an evaluation of the evidence base},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In an influenza pandemic, the benefit of vaccines and antiviral medications will be constrained by limitations on supplies and effectiveness. Non-pharmaceutical public health interventions will therefore be vital in curtailing disease spread. However, the most comprehensive assessments of the literature to date recognize the generally poor quality of evidence on which to base non-pharmaceutical pandemic planning decisions. In light of the need to prepare for a possible pandemic despite concerns about the poor quality of the literature, combining available evidence with expert opinion about the relative merits of non-pharmaceutical interventions for pandemic influenza may lead to a more informed and widely accepted set of recommendations. We evaluated the evidence base for non-pharmaceutical public health interventions. Then, based on the collective evidence, we identified a set of recommendations for and against interventions that are specific to both the setting in which an intervention may be used and the pandemic phase, and which can be used by policymakers to prepare for a pandemic until scientific evidence can definitively respond to planners' needs. METHODS: Building on reviews of past pandemics and recent historical inquiries, we evaluated the relative merits of non-pharmaceutical interventions by combining available evidence from the literature with qualitative and quantitative expert opinion. Specifically, we reviewed the recent scientific literature regarding the prevention of human-to-human transmission of pandemic influenza, convened a meeting of experts from multiple disciplines, and elicited expert recommendation about the use of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions in a variety of settings (healthcare facilities; community-based institutions; private households) and pandemic phases (no pandemic; no US pandemic; early localized US pandemic; advanced US pandemic). RESULTS: The literature contained a dearth of evidence on the efficacy or effectiveness of most non-pharmaceutical interventions for influenza. In an effort to inform decision-making in the absence of strong scientific evidence, the experts ultimately endorsed hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, surveillance and case reporting, and rapid viral diagnosis in all settings and during all pandemic phases. They also encouraged patient and provider use of masks and other personal protective equipment as well as voluntary self-isolation of patients during all pandemic phases. Other non-pharmaceutical interventions including mask-use and other personal protective equipment for the general public, school and workplace closures early in an epidemic, and mandatory travel restrictions were rejected as likely to be ineffective, infeasible, or unacceptable to the public. CONCLUSION: The demand for scientific evidence on non-pharmaceutical public health interventions for influenza is pervasive, and present policy recommendations must rely heavily on expert judgment. In the absence of a definitive science base, our assessment of the evidence identified areas for further investigation as well as non-pharmaceutical public health interventions that experts believe are likely to be beneficial, feasible and widely acceptable in an influenza pandemic.},

title = {Association of glycaemia with macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes (UKPDS 35): prospective observational study},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the relation between exposure to glycaemia over time and the risk of macrovascular or microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. Setting: 23 hospital based clinics in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Participants: 4585 white, Asian Indian, and Afro-Caribbean UKPDS patients, whether randomised or not to treatment, were included in analyses of incidence; of these, 3642 were included in analyses of relative risk. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary predefined aggregate clinical outcomes: any end point or deaths related to diabetes and all cause mortality. Secondary aggregate outcomes: myocardial infarction, stroke, amputation (including death from peripheral vascular disease), and microvascular disease (predominantly retinal photo-coagulation). Single end points: non-fatal heart failure and cataract extraction. Risk reduction associated with a 1% reduction in updated mean HbA(1c) adjusted for possible confounders at diagnosis of diabetes. RESULTS: The incidence of clinical complications was significantly associated with glycaemia. Each 1% reduction in updated mean HbA(1c) was associated with reductions in risk of 21% for any end point related to diabetes (95% confidence interval 17% to 24%, P<0.0001), 21% for deaths related to diabetes (15% to 27%, P<0.0001), 14% for myocardial infarction (8% to 21%, P<0.0001), and 37% for microvascular complications (33% to 41%, P<0.0001). No threshold of risk was observed for any end point. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes the risk of diabetic complications was strongly associated with previous hyperglycaemia. Any reduction in HbA(1c) is likely to reduce the risk of complications, with the lowest risk being in those with HbA(1c) values in the normal range (<6.0%).},

title = {Multi-host transmission dynamics of Schistosoma japonicum in Samar province, the Philippines},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among the 6.7 million people living in areas of the Philippines where infection with Schistosoma japonicum is considered endemic, even within small geographical areas levels of infection vary considerably. In general, the ecological drivers of this variability are not well described. Unlike other schistosomes, S. japonicum is known to infect several mammalian hosts. However, the relative contribution of different hosts to the transmission cycle is not well understood. Here, we characterize the transmission dynamics of S. japonicum using data from an extensive field study and a mathematical transmission model. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, stool samples were obtained from 5,623 humans and 5,899 potential nonhuman mammalian hosts in 50 villages in the Province of Samar, the Philippines. These data, with variable numbers of samples per individual, were adjusted for known specificities and sensitivities of the measurement techniques before being used to estimate the parameters of a mathematical transmission model, under the assumption that the dynamic transmission processes of infection and recovery were in a steady state in each village. The model was structured to allow variable rates of transmission from different mammals (humans, dogs, cats, pigs, domesticated water buffalo, and rats) to snails and from snails to mammals. First, we held transmission parameters constant for all villages and found that no combination of mammalian population size and prevalence of infectivity could explain the observed variability in prevalence of infection between villages. We then allowed either the underlying rate of transmission (a) from snails to mammals or (b) from mammals to snails to vary by village. Our data provided substantially more support for model structure (a) than for model structure (b). Fitted values for the village-level transmission intensity from snails to mammals appeared to be strongly spatially correlated, which is consistent with results from descriptive hierarchical analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the process of acquiring mammalian S. japonicum infection is more important in explaining differences in prevalence of infection between villages than the process of snails becoming infected. Also, the contribution from water buffaloes to human S. japonicum infection in the Philippines is less important than has been recently observed for bovines in China. These findings have implications for the prioritization of mitigating interventions against S. japonicum transmission.},

title = {Simulating the effect of quarantine on the spread of the 1918-19 flu in central Canada},
abstract = {Quarantine is often proposed and sometimes used to control the spread of infectious diseases through a human population. Yet there is usually little or no information on the effectiveness of attempting to quarantine humans that is not of an anecdotal or conjectural nature. This paper describes how a compartmental model for the geographic spread of infectious diseases can be used to address the potential effectiveness of human quarantine. The model is applied to data from the historical record in central Canada around the time of the 1918-19 influenza epidemic. Information on the daily mobility patterns of individuals engaged in the fur trade throughout the region prior to, during, and immediately after the epidemic are used to determine whether rates of travel were affected by informal quarantine policies imposed by community leaders. The model is then used to assess the impact of observed differences in travel on the spread of the epidemic. Results show that when mobility rates are very low, as in this region, quarantine practices must be highly effective before they alter disease patterns significantly. Simulation results suggest, though, that effectiveness varies depending on when the limitation on travel between communities is implemented and how long it lasts, and that a policy of introducing quarantine at the earliest possible time may not always lead to the greatest reduction in cases of a disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In late March 2009, an outbreak of a respiratory illness later proved to be caused by novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) was identified in Mexico. We describe the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of persons hospitalized for pneumonia at the national tertiary hospital for respiratory illnesses in Mexico City who had laboratory-confirmed S-OIV infection, also known as swine flu. METHODS: We used retrospective medical chart reviews to collect data on the hospitalized patients. S-OIV infection was confirmed in specimens with the use of a real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay. RESULTS: From March 24 through April 24, 2009, a total of 18 cases of pneumonia and confirmed S-OIV infection were identified among 98 patients hospitalized for acute respiratory illness at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City. More than half of the 18 case patients were between 13 and 47 years of age, and only 8 had preexisting medical conditions. For 16 of the 18 patients, this was the first hospitalization for their illness; the other 2 patients were referred from other hospitals. All patients had fever, cough, dyspnea or respiratory distress, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, and bilateral patchy pneumonia. Other common findings were an increased creatine kinase level (in 62% of patients) and lymphopenia (in 61%). Twelve patients required mechanical ventilation, and seven died. Within 7 days after contact with the initial case patients, a mild or moderate influenza-like illness developed in 22 health care workers; they were treated with oseltamivir, and none were hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: S-OIV infection can cause severe illness, the acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death in previously healthy persons who are young to middle-aged. None of the secondary infections among health care workers were severe. Copyright 2009 Massachusetts Medical Society.},

abstract = {We used a deterministic SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) meta-population model, together with scenario, sensitivity, and simulation analyses, to determine stockpiling strategies for neuraminidase inhibitors that would minimize absenteeism among healthcare workers. A pandemic with a basic reproductive number (R0) of 2.5 resulted in peak absenteeism of 10%. Treatment decreased peak absenteeism to 8%, while 8 weeks' prophylaxis reduced it to 2%. For pandemics with higher R0, peak absenteeism exceeded 20% occasionally and 6 weeks' prophylaxis reduced peak absenteeism by 75%. Insufficient duration of prophylaxis increased peak absenteeism compared with treatment only. Earlier pandemic detection and initiation of prophylaxis may render shorter prophylaxis durations ineffective. Eight weeks' prophylaxis substantially reduced peak absenteeism under a broad range of assumptions for severe pandemics (peak absenteeism > 10%). Small investments in treatment and prophylaxis, if adequate and timely, can reduce absenteeism among essential staff.},

title = {Dating the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses},
abstract = {Pandemic influenza viruses cause significant mortality in humans. In the 20th century, 3 influenza viruses caused major pandemics: the 1918 H1N1 virus, the 1957 H2N2 virus, and the 1968 H3N2 virus. These pandemics were initiated by the introduction and successful adaptation of a novel hemagglutinin subtype to humans from an animal source, resulting in antigenic shift. Despite global concern regarding a new pandemic influenza, the emergence pathway of pandemic strains remains unknown. Here we estimated the evolutionary history and inferred date of introduction to humans of each of the genes for all 20th century pandemic influenza strains. Our results indicate that genetic components of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus circulated in mammalian hosts, i.e., swine and humans, as early as 1911 and was not likely to be a recently introduced avian virus. Phylogenetic relationships suggest that the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 virus (BM/1918) was generated by reassortment between mammalian viruses and a previously circulating human strain, either in swine or, possibly, in humans. Furthermore, seasonal and classic swine H1N1 viruses were not derived directly from BM/1918, but their precursors co-circulated during the pandemic. Mean estimates of the time of most recent common ancestor also suggest that the H2N2 and H3N2 pandemic strains may have been generated through reassortment events in unknown mammalian hosts and involved multiple avian viruses preceding pandemic recognition. The possible generation of pandemic strains through a series of reassortment events in mammals over a period of years before pandemic recognition suggests that appropriate surveillance strategies for detection of precursor viruses may abort future pandemics.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the first 10 weeks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong. The epidemic to date has been characterized by two large clusters-initiated by two separate "super-spread" events (SSEs)-and by ongoing community transmission. By fitting a stochastic model to data on 1512 cases, including these clusters, we show that the etiological agent of SARS is moderately transmissible. Excluding SSEs, we estimate that 2.7 secondary infections were generated per case on average at the start of the epidemic, with a substantial contribution from hospital transmission. Transmission rates fell during the epidemic, primarily as a result of reductions in population contact rates and improved hospital infection control, but also because of more rapid hospital attendance by symptomatic individuals. As a result, the epidemic is now in decline, although continued vigilance is necessary for this to be maintained. Restrictions on longer range population movement are shown to be a potentially useful additional control measure in some contexts. We estimate that most currently infected persons are now hospitalized, which highlights the importance of control of nosocomial transmission.},

title = {Ecology and evolution of the flu},
abstract = {Influenza (flu) is a common infectious disease, but it is unusual in that the primary timescales for disease dynamics (epidemics) and viral evolution (new variants) are roughly the same. Recently, extraordinarily reliable phylogenetic reconstructions of flu virus evolution have been made using samples from both extant and extinct strains. In addition, because of their public health importance, flu epidemics have been monitored throughout the period over which the phylogenetic trees extend. In parallel with this empirical work, theoretical ecologists have developed mathematical and computational models that elucidate many properties of multistrain systems. In the future, to unravel and interpret the complex interactions between ecological and evolutionary forces on flu dynamics, the documented evolution of the virus must be related to the observed population dynamics of the disease. New theoretical insights are also required to simplify model structures and facilitate predictions that can be tested with accessible data.},

Our meta-analysis, which included all identified studies except those on wild animal handlers, yielded an overall seroprevalence of 0.10% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.18]. Health-care workers and others who had close contact with SARS patients had a slightly higher degree of seroconversion (0.23%, 95% CI 0.02-0.45) compared to healthy blood donors, others from the general community or non-SARS patients recruited from the health-care setting (0.16%, 95% CI 0-0.37). When analysed by the two broad classes of testing procedures, it is clear that serial confirmatory test protocols resulted in a much lower estimate (0.050%, 95% CI 0-0.15) than single test protocols (0.20%, 95% CI 0.06-0.34). Potential epidemiological and laboratory pitfalls are also discussed as they may give rise to false or inconsistent results in measuring the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV.},

title = {Evolutionary dynamics and emergence of panzootic H5N1 influenza viruses},
abstract = {The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus lineage has undergone extensive genetic reassortment with viruses from different sources to produce numerous H5N1 genotypes, and also developed into multiple genetically distinct sublineages in China. From there, the virus has spread to over 60 countries. The ecological success of this virus in diverse species of both poultry and wild birds with frequent introduction to humans suggests that it is a likely source of the next human pandemic. Therefore, the evolutionary and ecological characteristics of its emergence from wild birds into poultry are of considerable interest. Here, we apply the latest analytical techniques to infer the early evolutionary dynamics of H5N1 virus in the population from which it emerged (wild birds and domestic poultry). By estimating the time of most recent common ancestors of each gene segment, we show that the H5N1 prototype virus was likely introduced from wild birds into poultry as a non-reassortant low pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus and was not generated by reassortment in poultry. In contrast, more recent H5N1 genotypes were generated locally in aquatic poultry after the prototype virus (A/goose/Guangdong/1/96) introduction occurred, i.e., they were not a result of additional emergence from wild birds. We show that the H5N1 virus was introduced into Indonesia and Vietnam 3-6 months prior to detection of the first outbreaks in those countries. Population dynamics analyses revealed a rapid increase in the genetic diversity of A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 lineage viruses from mid-1999 to early 2000. Our results suggest that the transmission of reassortant viruses through the mixed poultry population in farms and markets in China has selected HPAI H5N1 viruses that are well adapted to multiple hosts and reduced the interspecies transmission barrier of those viruses.},

abstract = {A novel influenza A (H1N1) virus has spread rapidly across the globe. Judging its pandemic potential is difficult with limited data, but nevertheless essential to inform appropriate health responses. By analyzing the outbreak in Mexico, early data on international spread, and viral genetic diversity, we make an early assessment of transmissibility and severity. Our estimates suggest that 23,000 (range 6,000-32,000) individuals had been infected in Mexico by late April, giving an estimated case fatality ratio (CFR) of 0.4% (range 0.3% to 1.5%) based on confirmed and suspect deaths reported to that time. In a community outbreak in the small community of La Gloria, Veracruz no deaths were attributed to infection, giving an upper 95% bound on CFR of 0.6%. Thus while substantial uncertainty remains, clinical severity appears less than that seen in 1918 but comparable with that seen in 1957. Clinical attack rates in children in La Gloria were twice that in adults (<15 years-of-age: 61%, >/=15: 29%). Three different epidemiological analyses gave R0 estimates in the range 1.4-1.6, while a genetic analysis gave a central estimate of 1.2. This range of values is, consistent with 14 to 73 generations of human-to-human transmission having occurred in Mexico to late April. Transmissibility is therefore substantially higher than seasonal flu, and comparable with lower estimates of R0 obtained from previous influenza pandemics.},

title = {Dietary approaches to prevent and treat hypertension: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association},
abstract = {A substantial body of evidence strongly supports the concept that multiple dietary factors affect blood pressure (BP). Well-established dietary modifications that lower BP are reduced salt intake, weight loss, and moderation of alcohol consumption (among those who drink). Over the past decade, increased potassium intake and consumption of dietary patterns based on the "DASH diet" have emerged as effective strategies that also lower BP. Of substantial public health relevance are findings related to blacks and older individuals. Specifically, blacks are especially sensitive to the BP-lowering effects of reduced salt intake, increased potassium intake, and the DASH diet. Furthermore, it is well documented that older individuals, a group at high risk for BP-related cardiovascular and renal diseases, can make and sustain dietary changes. The risk of cardiovascular disease increases progressively throughout the range of BP, beginning at 115/75 mm Hg. In view of the continuing epidemic of BP-related diseases and the increasing prevalence of hypertension, efforts to reduce BP in both nonhypertensive and hypertensive individuals are warranted. In nonhypertensive individuals, dietary changes can lower BP and prevent hypertension. In uncomplicated stage I hypertension (systolic BP of 140 to 159 mm Hg or diastolic BP of 90 to 99 mm Hg), dietary changes serve as initial treatment before drug therapy. In those hypertensive patients already on drug therapy, lifestyle modifications, particularly a reduced salt intake, can further lower BP. The current challenge to healthcare providers, researchers, government officials, and the general public is developing and implementing effective clinical and public health strategies that lead to sustained dietary changes among individuals and more broadly among whole populations.},

abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses are now endemic in many Asian countries, resulting in repeated outbreaks in poultry and increased cases of human infection. The immediate precursor of these HPAI viruses is believed to be A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (Gs/GD)-like H5N1 HPAI viruses first detected in Guangdong, China, in 1996. From 2000 onwards, many novel reassortant H5N1 influenza viruses or genotypes have emerged in southern China. However, precursors of the Gs/GD-like viruses and their subsequent reassortants have not been fully determined. Here we characterize low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5 subtype viruses isolated from poultry and migratory birds in southern China and Europe from the 1970s to the 2000s. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Gs/GD-like virus was likely derived from an LPAI H5 virus in migratory birds. However, its variants arose from multiple reassortments between Gs/GD-like virus and viruses from migratory birds or with those Eurasian viruses isolated in the 1970s. It is of note that unlike HPAI H5N1 viruses, those recent LPAI H5 viruses have not become established in aquatic or terrestrial poultry. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the dynamic nature of the influenza virus gene pool in Eurasia with repeated transmissions between the eastern and western extremities of the continent. The data also show reassortment between influenza viruses from domestic and migratory birds in this region that has contributed to the expanded diversity of the influenza virus gene pool among poultry in Eurasia.},

Our point estimate of the effective reproductive number (Re) for the initial phase of the influenza A(H1N1)v epidemic in the Netherlands was below one. Given that the Re estimate is based on a small number of indigenous cases and a limited time period, it needs to be interpreted cautiously.},

title = {Influenza vaccination coverage among children aged 6-23 months - United States, 2007-08 influenza season},
abstract = {Infants and children aged <2 years often require medical care for influenza and have higher rates of influenza-related hospitalization than any other age group except persons aged >or=65 years. Since 2004, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended seasonal influenza vaccination for all children aged 6-23 months. Full vaccination for these children requires receipt of 2 doses in the current influenza season if they have not been vaccinated previously or received a single dose during the preceding season. To assess influenza vaccination coverage among children aged 6-23 months during September-December of the 2007-08 influenza season, CDC analyzed data from the 2008 National Immunization Survey (NIS). The results of those analyses indicated that, during the 4 months, 40.7% of children aged 6-23 months received >or=1 doses of influenza vaccine, and 23.4% were fully vaccinated. Substantial variability was observed among the 50 states and participating local areas; the percentage of children with full vaccination ranged from 6.4% to 40.9% among states and local areas. Nationally, the percentage of children aged 6-23 months receiving >or=1 doses of influenza vaccine increased from 31.8% in 2006-07 to 40.7% in 2007-08, and the percentage with full vaccination increased from 21.3% to 23.4%; however, influenza vaccination coverage among children remains low. Further study is needed to identify barriers to influenza vaccination and to implement strategies that can increase vaccination coverage with emphasis on attaining full vaccination in this population at greater risk for complications from influenza.},

title = {Estimation of vaccine efficacy in outbreaks of acute infectious diseases},
abstract = {In a previous paper we defined the efficacy of a vaccine as 1-beta 1/beta 0, where beta 0 is the instantaneous probability of transmission of infection to an unvaccinated person exposed to a single infectious person, and beta 1 is similarly defined for a vaccinated person. We showed that under the conditions of an outbreak of an acute, directly transmitted infectious disease in a homogeneous and randomly mixing population, an estimate of this measure of vaccine efficacy is 1-[1n(1-A1)/1n(1-A0)], where A0 and A1 are the observed final attack rates among unvaccinated and vaccinated persons, respectively. In the present work we present an approximation for the standard error of this estimator, accounting for both the sampling and process variation. We extend the results of our previous paper to a stratified population, where the strata correspond to different levels of susceptibility and may have different vaccination coverage. We also consider populations that consist of small units (for example, households) where individuals mix primarily in these units. In this case, definition of vaccine efficacy is in terms of the within-unit transmission probabilities and is estimable by using transmission models for infectious diseases. We apply the estimation methods described above to data from influenza and measles outbreaks. We also examine, via a stochastic simulation study, the robustness of the vaccine efficacy estimators under various population structures and mixing patterns.},

title = {Parasitological impact of 2-year preventive chemotherapy on schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis in Uganda},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) are among the neglected tropical diseases in Africa. A national control program for these diseases was initiated in Uganda during March 2003. Annual treatment with praziquantel and albendazole was given to schoolchildren in endemic areas and to adults in selected communities where local prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni in schoolchildren was high. METHODS: The impact of the treatment program was monitored through cohorts of schoolchildren and adults. Their infection status with S. mansoni and STH was determined by parasitological examinations at baseline and at annual follow-ups. The prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni and STH before and after treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: Two rounds of treatment significantly reduced the prevalence of S. mansoni infection in schoolchildren across three regions in the country from 33.4-49.3% to 9.7-29.6%, and intensity of infection from 105.7-386.8 eggs per gram of faeces (epg) to 11.6-84.1 epg. The prevalence of hookworm infection was reduced from 41.2-57.9% to 5.5-16.1%, and intensity of infection from 186.9-416.8 epg to 3.7-36.9 epg. The proportion of children with heavy S. mansoni infection was significantly reduced from 15% (95% CI 13.4-16.8%) to 2.3% (95% CI 1.6-3.0%). In adults, significant reduction in the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni and hookworm infections was also observed. More importantly, the prevalence and intensity of both S. mansoni and hookworm infections in the cohorts of newly-recruited 6-year-olds who had never previously received treatment decreased significantly over 2 years: 34.9% (95% CI 31.9-37.8%) to 22.6% (95% CI 19.9-25.2%) and 171.1 epg (95% CI 141.5-200.7) to 72.0 epg (95% CI 50.9-93.1) for S. mansoni; and 48.4% (95% CI 45.4-51.5) to 15.9% (95% CI 13.6-18.2) and 232.7 epg (95% CI 188.4-276.9) to 51.4 epg (95% CI 33.4-69.5) for hookworms, suggesting a general decline in environmental transmission levels. CONCLUSION: Annual anthelminthic treatment delivered to schoolchildren and to adults at high risk in Uganda can significantly reduce the prevalence and intensity of infection for schistosomiasis and STH, and potentially also significantly reduce levels of environmental transmission of infection.},

title = {Cross-Reactive Antibody Responses to the 2009 Pandemic H1N1 Influenza Virus},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A new pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus has emerged, causing illness globally, primarily in younger age groups. To assess the level of preexisting immunity in humans and to evaluate seasonal vaccine strategies, we measured the antibody response to the pandemic virus resulting from previous influenza infection or vaccination in different age groups. METHODS: Using a microneutralization assay, we measured cross-reactive antibodies to pandemic H1N1 virus (2009 H1N1) in stored serum samples from persons who either donated blood or were vaccinated with recent seasonal or 1976 swine influenza vaccines. RESULTS: A total of 4 of 107 persons (4%) who were born after 1980 had preexisting cross-reactive antibody titers of 40 or more against 2009 H1N1, whereas 39 of 115 persons (34%) born before 1950 had titers of 80 or more. Vaccination with seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines resulted in an increase in the level of cross-reactive antibody to 2009 H1N1 by a factor of four or more in none of 55 children between the ages of 6 months and 9 years, in 12 to 22% of 231 adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years, and in 5% or less of 113 adults 60 years of age or older. Seasonal vaccines that were formulated with adjuvant did not further enhance cross-reactive antibody responses. Vaccination with the A/New Jersey/1976 swine influenza vaccine substantially boosted cross-reactive antibodies to 2009 H1N1 in adults. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with recent seasonal nonadjuvanted or adjuvanted influenza vaccines induced little or no cross-reactive antibody response to 2009 H1N1 in any age group. Persons under the age of 30 years had little evidence of cross-reactive antibodies to the pandemic virus. However, a proportion of older adults had preexisting cross-reactive antibodies.

title = {Social and geographic distance in HIV risk},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between social distance (measured as the geodesic, or shortest distance, between 2 people in a connected network) and geographic distance (measured as the actual distance between them in kilometers [km]). STUDY: We used data from a study of 595 persons at risk for HIV and their sexual and drug-using partners (total N = 8920 unique individuals) conducted in Colorado Springs, Colorado, from 1988 to 1992--a longitudinal cohort study that ascertained sociodemographic, clinical, behavioral, and network information about participants. We used place of residence as the geographic marker and calculated distance between people grouped by various characteristics of interest. RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of all dyads were separated by a distance of 4 km or less. The closest pairs were persons who both shared needles and had sexual contact (mean = 3.2 km), and HIV-positive persons and their contacts (mean = 2.9). The most distant pairs were prostitutes and their paying partners (mean = 6.1 km). In a connected subset of 348 respondents, almost half the persons were between 3 and 6 steps from each other in the social network and were separated by a distance of 2 to 8 km. Using block group centroids, the mean distance between all persons in Colorado Springs was 12.4 km compared with a mean distance of 5.4 km between all dyads in this study (P <0.0001). The subgroup of HIV-positive people and their contacts was drawn in real space on a map of Colorado Springs and revealed tight clustering of this group in the downtown area. CONCLUSION: The association of social and geographic distance in an urban group of people at risk for HIV provides demonstration of the importance of geographic clustering in the potential transmission of HIV. The proximity of persons connected within a network, but not necessarily known to each other, suggests that a high probability of partner selection from within the group may be an important factor in maintenance of HIV endemicity.},

title = {Viral loads and duration of viral shedding in adult patients hospitalized with influenza},
abstract = {Background. The goal of this study was to characterize viral loads and factors affecting viral clearance in persons with severe influenza. Methods. This was a 1-year prospective, observational study involving consecutive adults hospitalized with influenza. Nasal and throat swabs were collected at presentation, then daily until 1 week after symptom onset. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to determine viral RNA concentration and virus isolation were performed. Viral RNA concentration was analyzed using multiple linear or logistic regressions or mixed-effect models. Results. One hundred forty-seven inpatients with influenza A (H3N2) infection were studied (mean age +/- standard deviation, [Formula: see text] years). Viral RNA concentration at presentation positively correlated with symptom scores and was significantly higher than that among time-matched outpatients (control subjects). Patients with major comorbidities had high viral RNA concentration even when presenting >2 days after symptom onset (mean +/- standard deviation, [Formula: see text] vs [Formula: see text] log(10) copies/mL; [Formula: see text]; beta, +0.86 [95% confidence interval, +0.03 to +1.68]). Viral RNA concentration demonstrated a nonlinear decrease with time; 26% of oseltamivir-treated and 57% of untreated patients had RNA detected at 1 week after symptom onset. Oseltamivir started on or before symptom day 4 was independently associated with an accelerated decrease in viral RNA concentration (mean beta [standard error], -1.19 [0.43] and -0.68 [0.33] log(10) copies/mL for patients treated on day 1 and days 2-3, respectively; [Formula: see text]) and viral RNA clearance at 1 week (odds ratio, 0.10 [95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.35] and 0.30 [0.10-0.90] for patients treated on day 1-2 and day 3-4, respectively). Conversely, major comorbidities and systemic corticosteroid use for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations were associated with slower viral clearance. Viral RNA clearance was associated with a shorter hospital stay (7.0 vs 13.5 days; [Formula: see text]). Conclusion. Patients hospitalized with severe influenza have more active and prolonged viral replication. Weakened host defenses slow viral clearance, whereas antivirals started within the first 4 days of illness enhance viral clearance.},

abstract = {In April 2009, in the United States, the first cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection were reported. On June 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an influenza pandemic because of widespread transmission worldwide. As of September 13, all six WHO regions had reported approximately 296,471 cases of pandemic H1N1, including 3,486 deaths. On June 29, the first case of pandemic H1N1 was confirmed in Kenya. At that time, only four other countries in sub-Saharan Africa had reported cases, and secondary transmission had not been documented in the region. Surveillance activities in Kenya detected four separate introductions of the virus into the country. The introductions provided an opportunity to study transmission of the virus (including calculation of secondary household attack rates) in a virus-naive population that had not yet initiated the use of antiviral drugs. This report describes the four introductions and the accompanying analysis. The overall rate of secondary household transmission of laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 was 26% (range: 7%--33%), which is comparable to secondary household attack rates reported for laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza virus infection. However, additional and more rigorous studies are needed to better understand the secondary attack rates associated with the current pandemic.},

abstract = {The analysis of routinely collected surveillance data is an important challenge in public health practice. We present a method based on a hidden Markov model for monitoring such time series. The model characterizes the sequence of measurements by assuming that its probability density function depends on the state of an underlying Markov chain. The parameter vector includes distribution parameters and transition probabilities between the states. Maximum likelihood estimates are obtained with a modified EM algorithm. Extensions are provided to take into account trend and seasonality in the data. The method is demonstrated on two examples: the first seeks to characterize influenza-like illness incidence rates with a mixture of Gaussian distributions, and the other, poliomyelitis counts with mixture of Poisson distributions. The results justify a wider use of this method for analysing surveillance data.},

The inoculated pigs started virus excretion in nasal swabs at 1 day p.i. onwards and developed generally mild symptoms including fever, sneezing, nasal discharge, and diarrhea. Contact pigs became infected, shed virus and developed clinical symptoms similarly to the inoculated animals. Plasma samples of all animals remained negative for viral RNA. NP- and H1-specific antibodies could be detected by ELISA 7 days p.i. CD4+ T-cells became activated immediately after infection and both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations expanded 3 to 7 days p.i. coinciding with clinical signs.

abstract = {This paper is concerned with estimation of the threshold parameter R-* for a stochastic model for the spread of a susceptible --> infective --> removed epidemic among a closed, finite population that contains several types of individual and is partitioned into households. It turns out that R-* cannot be estimated consistently from final outcome data, so a Perron-Frobenius argument is used to obtain sharp lower and upper bounds for R-*, which can be estimated consistently. Determining the allocation of vaccines that reduces the upper bound for R-* to its threshold value of one, thus preventing the occurrence of a major outbreak, with minimum vaccine coverage is shown to be a linear programming problem. The estimates of R-*, before and after vaccination, and of the secure vaccination coverage, i.e. the proportion of individuals that have to be vaccinated to reduce the upper bound for R-* to 1 assuming an optimal vaccination scheme, are equipped with standard errors, thus yielding conservative confidence bounds for these key epidemiological parameters. The methodology is illustrated by application to data on influenza outbreaks in Tecumseh, Michigan.},

title = {Modelling the spread of foot-and-mouth disease in Australia},
abstract = {Preparedness for an incursion of an exotic animal disease is of key importance to government, industry, producers and the Australian community. An important aspect of Australia's preparedness for a possible incursion of foot-and-mouth disease is investigation into the likely effectiveness and cost-efficiency of eradication strategies when applied to different regional outbreak scenarios. Disease modelling is a tool that can be used to study diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease to better understand potential disease spread and control under different conditions. The Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has been involved with epidemiologic simulation modelling for more than 10 years, and has developed a sophisticated spatial model for foot-and-mouth disease (AusSpread) that operates within a geographic information system framework. The model accommodates real farm boundary or point-location data, as well as synthesised data based on agricultural census and land use information. The model also allows for interactions between herds or flocks of different animal species and production type, and considers the role that such interactions are likely to play in the epidemiology of a regional outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The user can choose mitigations and eradication strategies from those that are currently described in Australia's veterinary emergency plan. The model also allows the user to evaluate the impact of constraints on the availability of resources for mitigations or eradication measures. Outputs include a range of maps and tabulated outbreak statistics describing the geographic extent of the outbreak and its duration, the numbers of affected, slaughtered, and, as relevant, vaccinated herds or flocks, and the cost of control and eradication. Cost-related outputs are based on budgets of the value of stock and the cost of mitigations, each of which can be varied by the user. These outputs are a valuable resource to assist with policy development and disease management.},

Long-term studies of infection and disease ecology in catchments in Sichuan have been supplemented by detailed hydrometric measurements to produce a model of water velocity and flow in an irrigation system. The model provides a means of estimating travel times of two infectious stages of the parasite from source sites to water contact exposure sites for individuals of both the human population and the intermediate vector snail populations. The hydrological transport model will be part of an overall model of schistosomiasis transmission in the catchments. A GIS system is used to manage spatial data of the drainage network, land use, infection sources and population centres. The development of the Three Gorges Dam in China will increase marshlands and irrigation in areas currently free of schistosomiasis. The potential for the spread of schistosomiasis into these new areas is a major concern. Hydrological models can be of particular importance in assessing future environmental risk.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To characterize the epidemiology and to determine the prognosis factors in severe community-acquired pneumonia among patients admitted to an intensive care unit. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. SETTING: Intensive Care and Infectious Diseases Unit of a municipal general hospital of Lille University Medical School. PATIENTS: 299 consecutive patients exhibiting severe community-acquired pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: On admission to ICU, 149 patients required mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure and 44 exhibited septic shock. Pulmonary involvement was bilateral in 71 patients. There were 260 organisms isolated from 197 patients (65.9%), the most frequent being Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 80), Staphylococcus spp. (n = 57) and Gram-negative bacilli (n = 81). Overall mortality was 28.5% (85 patients). According to univariate analysis, mortality was associated with age over 60 years, anticipated death within 5 years, immunosuppression, shock, mechanical ventilation, bilateral pulmonary involvement, bacteremia, neutrophil count < 3500/mm3, total serum protein level < 45 g/l, serum creatinine > 15 mg/l, non-aspiration pneumonia, ineffective initial therapy and complications. Multivariate analysis selected only 5 factors significantly associated with prognosis: anticipated death within 5 years, shock, bacteremia, non-pneumonia-related complications and ineffective initial therapy. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of the initial therapy appears to be the most significant prognosis factor and, as the one and only related to the initial medical intervention, suggests a need for permanent optimization of our antimicrobial strategies.},

abstract = {The development of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses in poultry in Eurasia accompanied with the increase in human infection in 2006 suggests that the virus has not been effectively contained and that the pandemic threat persists. Updated virological and epidemiological findings from our market surveillance in southern China demonstrate that H5N1 influenza viruses continued to be panzootic in different types of poultry. Genetic and antigenic analyses revealed the emergence and predominance of a previously uncharacterized H5N1 virus sublineage (Fujian-like) in poultry since late 2005. Viruses from this sublineage gradually replaced those multiple regional distinct sublineages and caused recent human infection in China. These viruses have already transmitted to Hong Kong, Laos, Malaysia, and Thailand, resulting in a new transmission and outbreak wave in Southeast Asia. Serological studies suggest that H5N1 seroconversion in market poultry is low and that vaccination may have facilitated the selection of the Fujian-like sublineage. The predominance of this virus over a large geographical region within a short period directly challenges current disease control measures.},

abstract = {The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence and distribution of distended abdomens among Ugandan school children across a range of eco-epidemiological settings and to investigate the relationship between distended abdomens and helminth infections, in particular Schistosoma mansoni, before and 1-year after anthelminthic treatment. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 4354 school children across eight districts, with a longitudinal 1-year follow-up of 2644 children (60.7%). On both occasions, parasitological, biometrical and clinical data were collected for each child. Baseline prevalence of S. mansoni and hookworms was 44.3% and 51.8%, respectively. Distended abdomens, defined as an abdominal circumference ratio (ACR) >1.05, were observed in 2.5% of the sampled children, several of whom presented with particularly severe distensions necessitating hospital referral. ACR scores were highly overdispersed between districts and schools. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that S. mansoni infection accounted for only a small fraction of ACR variation, suggesting that either single point prevalence and intensity measures failed to reflect this more chronically evolved morbidity and/or that other interacting factors were involved, e.g. malnutrition and malaria. At 1-year follow-up, ACR scores showed an overall trend of regression towards the mean, potentially indicative of amelioration following chemotherapy, but geographic overdispersion still remained.},

title = {Simulation of mechanisms of viral interference in influenza},
abstract = {Biological interference among viral agents might have significant implications for disease prevention and therapy. Field data for influenza yield conflicting evidence concerning the independence of infection rates, or disease severity, for two co-circulating viruses. To examine the effects of several assumed modes of interference for influenza, simulations of a Monte Carlo micropopulation model of influenza epidemics have been performed. Model parameters were selected so that the simulated attack rates for each of two different viral strains matched actual field data. Rates of infection were compared for single agents and for two viruses with only behavioural interference. Other simulations included temporary immunity to the other virus for the duration of the infection, and/or reduced shedding of viral particles for dual infections. Simulated viral competition had little impact on epidemic severity, duration, or size distribution. Under the conditions studied, viral interference in natural populations would be difficult to infer from field observations of attack rates. Other simulations extended a partial immunity and/or reduced viral shedding during an infection with a second virus. These indicated that interference might be suggested by field data, but it could not be demonstrated conclusively. Still other simulations showed that for epidemics with much higher attack rates for both viruses, it would be relatively easy to demonstrate interference. However, in order to observe interference between influenza strains, it would be necessary to monitor on an almost daily basis, using a method of viral detection which would have to be both highly specific and also very sensitive.},

title = {Treatment and outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia at Canadian hospitals},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia is a common disease with a large economic burden. We assessed clinical practices and outcomes among patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to Canadian hospitals. METHODS: A total of 20 hospitals (11 teaching and 9 community) participated. Data from the charts of adults admitted during November 1996, January 1997 and March 1997 were reviewed to determine length of stay (LOS), admission to an intensive care unit and 30-day in-hospital mortality. Multivariate analyses examined sources of variability in LOS. The type and duration of antibiotic therapy and the proportion of patients who were treated according to clinical practice guidelines were determined. RESULTS: A total of 858 eligible patients were identified; their mean age was 69.4 (standard deviation 17.7) years. The overall median LOS was 7.0 days (interquartile range [IQR] 4.0-11.0 days); the median LOS ranged from 5.0 to 9.0 days across hospitals (IQR 6.0-7.8 days). Only 22% of the variability in LOS could be explained by known factors (disease severity 12%; presence of chronic obstructive lung disease or bacterial cause for the pneumonia 2%; hospital site 7%). The overall 30-day mortality was 14.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.8%-16.6%); 13.6% of the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit (95% CI 11.4%-16.1%). The median duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy was 5 days (range 3.0-6.5 days across hospitals). Although 79.8% of patients received treatment according to clinical practice guidelines, the rate of compliance with the guidelines ranged from 47.9% to 100% across hospitals. INTERPRETATION: Considerable heterogeneity exists in the management of community-acquired pneumonia at Canadian hospitals, the causes of which are poorly understood.},

The objectives of the present study were to identify risk factors for infection on poultry farms located in regions that had the highest number of outbreaks (Veneto and Lombardia) and the impact of pre-emptive culling as a complementary measure for eradicating infection. A Cox regression model that included spatial factors, such as the G index, was used. The results confirmed the relationship between risk of infection and poultry species, production type and size of farms. The effectiveness of pre-emptive culling was confirmed. An increased risk of infection was observed for poultry farms located near an infected farm and those at altitudes less than 150m above sea level. The measures for the control and eradication of AI virus infection need to consider species differences in susceptibility, the types of production and the density of poultry farms in the affected areas.},

title = {Potential for a global dynamic of Influenza A (H1N1)},
abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Geographical and temporal diffusion patterns of a human pandemic due to Swine Origin Influenza Virus (S-OIV) remain uncertain. The extent to which national and international pandemic preparedness plans and control strategies can slow or stop the process is not known. However, despite preparedness efforts, it appears that, particularly in the USA, Mexico, Canada and the UK, local chains of virus transmission can sustain autonomous dynamics which may lead to the next pandemic. Forecasts of influenza experts usually rely on information related to new circulating strains. METHODS: We attempted to quantify the possible spread of the pandemic across a network of 52 major cities and to predict the effect of vaccination against the pandemic strain, if available. Predictions are based on simulations from a stochastic SEIR model. Parameters used in the simulations are set to values consistent with recent estimations from the outbreak in Mexico. RESULTS: We show that a two-wave pandemic dynamic may be observed in Southern hemisphere because of seasonal constraints for a maximum value of the basic reproductive number (R0,max) within a city equal to 1.5 and a mean generation interval (GI) of 2 days. In this case and in the absence of vaccination, attack rates may reach 46% when considering a completely susceptible population. More severe scenarios characterized by higher values of R0,max (2.2) and GI (3.1) yield an attack rate of 77%. By extrapolation, we find that mass vaccination in all countries (i.e. up to 50% of the population) implemented 6 months after the start of the pandemic may reduce the cumulative number of cases by 91% in the case of the low transmissible strain (R0,max=1.5). This relative reduction is only 44% for R0,max=2.2 since most of the cases occur in the first 6 months and so before the vaccination campaign. CONCLUSION: Although uncertainties remain about the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the new influenza strain, this study provides the first analysis of the potential spread of the pandemic and first assessment of the impact of different immunization strategies.},

title = {Spread of infectious disease through clustered populations},
abstract = {Networks of person-to-person contacts form the substrate along which infectious diseases spread. Most network-based studies of this spread focus on the impact of variations in degree (the number of contacts an individual has). However, other effects such as clustering, variations in infectiousness or susceptibility, or variations in closeness of contacts may play a significant role. We develop analytic techniques to predict how these effects alter the growth rate, probability and size of epidemics, and validate the predictions with a realistic social network. We find that (for a given degree distribution and average transmissibility) clustering is the dominant factor controlling the growth rate, heterogeneity in infectiousness is the dominant factor controlling the probability of an epidemic and heterogeneity in susceptibility is the dominant factor controlling the size of an epidemic. Edge weights (measuring closeness or duration of contacts) have impact only if correlations exist between different edges. Combined, these effects can play a minor role in reinforcing one another, with the impact of clustering the largest when the population is maximally heterogeneous or if the closer contacts are also strongly clustered. Our most significant contribution is a systematic way to address clustering in infectious disease models, and our results have a number of implications for the design of interventions.},

Substantial changes in 2008 provided an opportunity to review the operation of the surveillance program as it existed during seven complete influenza seasons (1998-2005); the review was conducted in 2008. A unique aspect of the DoD program was the global reach for specimen collection and the ability to rapidly ship, process, and evaluate specimens from 27 countries. The resulting epidemiologic data combined with the culture results from >46,000 patients provided information that was shared with similar national and international programs, such as those of the CDC. Likewise, selected influenza isolates were molecularly characterized and shared with the CDC to be compared with other surveillance programs.

title = {Transmissibility of the influenza virus in the 1918 pandemic},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: With a heightened increase in concern for an influenza pandemic we sought to better understand the 1918 Influenza pandemic, the most devastating epidemic of the previous century. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We use data from several communities in Maryland, USA as well as two ships that experienced well-documented outbreaks of influenza in 1918. Using a likelihood-based method and a nonparametric method, we estimate the serial interval and reproductive number throughout the course of each outbreak. This analysis shows the basic reproductive number to be slightly lower in the Maryland communities (between 1.34 and 3.21) than for the enclosed populations on the ships (R(0) = 4.97, SE = 3.31). Additionally the effective reproductive number declined to sub epidemic levels more quickly on the ships (within around 10 days) than in the communities (within 30-40 days). The mean serial interval for the ships was consistent (3.33, SE = 5.96 and 3.81, SE = 3.69), while the serial intervals in the communities varied substantially (between 2.83, SE = 0.53 and 8.28, SE = 951.95). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results illustrate the importance of considering the population dynamics when making statements about the epidemiological parameters of Influenza. The methods that we employ for estimation of the reproductive numbers and the serial interval can be easily replicated in other populations and with other diseases.},

abstract = {The global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 demonstrated the need to determine control strategies for exotic infections. The prior determination of such strategies, and the use of mathematical models to assist this, is hampered by the obvious lack of data. We propose an integral equation model of Kermack-McKendrick type that may be used to compare strategies based on the isolation of infectious individuals. The model structures the incidence of infection according to the location of an infected individual at exposure, and requires knowledge of the infectivity kernel and the initial rate of exponential increase of cases. The model's use in the design of strategies to minimize the risk of SARS in a previously unexposed community is demonstrated.},

title = {Strategy for distribution of influenza vaccine to high-risk groups and children},
abstract = {Despite evidence that vaccinating schoolchildren against influenza is effective in limiting community-level transmission, the United States has had a long-standing government strategy of recommending that vaccine be concentrated primarily in high-risk groups and distributed to those people who keep the health system and social infrastructure operating. Because of this year's influenza vaccine shortage, a plan was enacted to distribute the limited vaccine stock to these groups first. This vaccination strategy, based on direct protection of those most at risk, has not been very effective in reducing influenza morbidity and mortality. Although it is too late to make changes this year, the current influenza vaccine crisis affords the opportunity to examine an alternative for future years. The alternative plan, supported by mathematical models and influenza field studies, would be to concentrate vaccine in schoolchildren, the population group most responsible for transmission, while also covering the reachable high-risk groups, who would also receive considerable indirect protection. In conjunction with a plan to ensure an adequate vaccine supply, this alternative influenza vaccination strategy would help control interpandemic influenza and be instrumental in preparing for pandemic influenza. The effectiveness of the alternative plan could be assessed through nationwide community studies.},

We use a combination of optimal control methods and epidemiological theory for metapopulations to address this problem. We consider what strategy should be used if the objective is to minimize the discounted number of infected individuals during the course of an epidemic. We show, for a system with two interconnected regions and an epidemic in which infected individuals recover and can be reinfected, that equalizing infection in the two regions is the worst possible strategy in minimizing the total level of infection. Treatment should instead be preferentially directed at the region with the lower level of infection, treating the other subpopulation only when there is resource left over. The same strategy holds with preferential treatments of regions with lower levels of infection when quarantine is introduced.},

abstract = {The dynamics of viral shedding and symptoms following influenza virus infection are key factors when considering epidemic control measures. The authors reviewed published studies describing the course of influenza virus infection in placebo-treated and untreated volunteers challenged with wild-type influenza virus. A total of 56 different studies with 1,280 healthy participants were considered. Viral shedding increased sharply between 0.5 and 1 day after challenge and consistently peaked on day 2. The duration of viral shedding averaged over 375 participants was 4.80 days (95% confidence interval: 4.31, 5.29). The frequency of symptomatic infection was 66.9% (95% confidence interval: 58.3, 74.5). Fever was observed in 37.0% of A/H1N1, 40.6% of A/H3N2 (p = 0.86), and 7.5% of B infections (p = 0.001). The total symptoms scores increased on day 1 and peaked on day 3. Systemic symptoms peaked on day 2. No such data exist for children or elderly subjects, but epidemiologic studies suggest that the natural history might differ. The present analysis confirms prior expert opinion on the duration of viral shedding or the frequency of asymptomatic influenza infection, extends prior knowledge on the dynamics of viral shedding and symptoms, and provides original results on the frequency of respiratory symptoms or fever.},

title = {Assessment of prognosis in patients with community-acquired pneumonia who require mechanical ventilation},
abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Knowing that mortality is high in patients who require mechanical ventilation patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), we hypothesized that the severity of acute lung injury could be used along with nonpulmonary factors to identify patients with the highest risk of death. We formulated a prediction model to quantitate the risk of hospital mortality in this population of patients. DESIGN: Historical prospective study using data collected over the first 24 h of mechanical ventilation. We utilized a hypoxemia index-(1 - lowest [PaO(2)/PAO(2)]) x (minimum fraction of inspired oxygen to maintain PaO(2) at > 60 mm Hg) x 100], where PAO(2) is the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen-to grade the severity of acute lung injury on a scale from 0 to 100. SETTING: Tertiary care university hospital ICU. PATIENTS: One hundred forty-four adult patients mechanically ventilated for respiratory failure caused by CAP. Measurements and results: Hospital mortality was 46% (n = 66). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed five independent predictors of hospital mortality: (1) the extent of lung injury assessed by the hypoxemia index; (2) the number of nonpulmonary organs that failed; (3) immunosuppression; (4) age > 80 years; and (5) medical comorbidity with a prognosis for survival < 5 years. At a 50% mortality threshold, the prediction model correctly classified outcome in 88% of cases. All patients with > 95% predicted probability of death died in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Based on clinical parameters measured over the first 24 h of mechanical ventilation, this model accurately identified critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with CAP for whom prolonged intensive care may not be of benefit.},

title = {Key transmission parameters of an institutional outbreak during the 1918 influenza pandemic estimated by mathematical modelling},
abstract = {AIM: To estimate the key transmission parameters associated with an outbreak of pandemic influenza in an institutional setting (New Zealand 1918). METHODS: Historical morbidity and mortality data were obtained from the report of the medical officer for a large military camp. A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered epidemiological model was solved numerically to find a range of best-fit estimates for key epidemic parameters and an incidence curve. Mortality data were subsequently modelled by performing a convolution of incidence distribution with a best-fit incidence-mortality lag distribution. RESULTS: Basic reproduction number (R0) values for three possible scenarios ranged between 1.3, and 3.1, and corresponding average latent period and infectious period estimates ranged between 0.7 and 1.3 days, and 0.2 and 0.3 days respectively. The mean and median best-estimate incidence-mortality lag periods were 6.9 and 6.6 days respectively. This delay is consistent with secondary bacterial pneumonia being a relatively important cause of death in this predominantly young male population. CONCLUSION: These R0 estimates are broadly consistent with others made for the 1918 influenza pandemic and are not particularly large relative to some other infectious diseases. This finding suggests that if a novel influenza strain of similar virulence emerged then it could potentially be controlled through the prompt use of major public health measures.},

abstract = {This paper treats a stochastic model for an SIR (susceptible-->infective-->removed) multitype household epidemic. The community is assumed to be closed, individuals are of different types and each individual belongs to a household. Previously obtained probabilistic and inferential results for the model are used to derive the optimal vaccination scheme. By this is meant the scheme that vaccinates the fewest among all vaccination schemes that reduce the threshold parameter below 1. This is done for the situation where all model parameters are known and also for the case where parameters are estimated from an outbreak in the community prior to vaccination. It is shown that the algorithm which chooses vaccines sequentially, at each step selecting the individual which reduces the threshold parameter the most, is not in general an optimal scheme. As a consequence, explicit characterisation of the optimal scheme is only possible in certain special cases. Two different types of vaccine responses, leaky and all-or-nothing, are considered and compared for the problems mentioned above. The methods are illustrated with some numerical examples.},

title = {Environmental effects on parasitic disease transmission exemplified by schistosomiasis in western China},
abstract = {Environmental effects on the transmission of many parasitic diseases are well recognized, but the role of specific factors like climate and agricultural practices in modulating transmission is seldom characterized quantitatively. Based on studies of Schistosoma japonicum transmission in irrigated agricultural environments in western China, a mathematical model was used to quantify environmental impacts on transmission intensity. The model was calibrated by using field data from intervention studies in three villages and simulated to predict the effects of alternative control options. Both the results of these interventions and earlier epidemiological findings confirm the central role of environmental factors, particularly those relating to snail habitat and agricultural and sanitation practices. Moreover, the findings indicate the inadequacy of current niclosamide-praziquantel strategies alone to achieve sustainable interruption of transmission in some endemic areas. More generally, the analysis suggests a village-specific index of transmission potential and how this potential is modulated by time-varying factors, including climatological variables, seasonal water-contact patterns, and irrigation practices. These time-variable factors, a village's internal potential, and its connectedness to its neighbors provide a framework for evaluating the likelihood of sustained schistosomiasis transmission and suggest an approach to quantifying the role of environmental factors for other parasitic diseases.},

abstract = {We have investigated a mathematical model for the transmission of Schistosoma japonicum in the infested region of northeastern Bohol island in the Philippines. The development of transmission models is important for planning control strategies. Since S. japonicum has a complicated mode of transmission, the rates of transmission among its hosts cannot be measured directly by field observation. Instead, they have been estimated through model analysis. The model takes into account the seasonal variations and includes a function of control measures. In 1981, a project to eliminate schistosomiasis started on Bohol island. The prevalence decreased dramatically and has kept low level less than 1%. The simulations based on the model predicted that there is little probability of resurgence of an epidemic in the northeastern endemic villages of Bohol island due to the fact that the project has attained a high coverage of selective mass treatment based on stool examination accompanied by a successful snail control operation.},

abstract = {We develop mathematical models of the transmission and evolution of multi-strain pathogens that incorporate strain extinction and the stochastic generation of new strains via mutation. The dynamics resulting from these models is then examined with the applied aim of understanding the mechanisms underpinning the evolution and dynamics of rapidly mutating pathogens, such as human influenza viruses. Our approach, while analytically relatively simple, gives results that are qualitatively similar to those obtained from much more complex individually based simulation models. We examine strain dynamics as a function of cross-immunity and key transmission parameters, and show that introducing strain extinction and modelling mutation as a stochastic process significantly changes the model dynamics, leading to lower strain diversity, reduced infection prevalence and shorter strain lifetimes. Finally, we incorporate transient strain-transcending immunity in the model and demonstrate that it reduces strain diversity further, giving patterns of sequential strain replacement similar to that seen in human influenza A viruses.},

title = {Severe Respiratory Disease Concurrent with the Circulation of H1N1 Influenza},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the spring of 2009, an outbreak of severe pneumonia was reported in conjunction with the concurrent isolation of a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV), widely known as swine flu, in Mexico. Influenza A (H1N1) subtype viruses have rarely predominated since the 1957 pandemic. The analysis of epidemic pneumonia in the absence of routine diagnostic tests can provide information about risk factors for severe disease from this virus and prospects for its control. METHODS: From March 24 to April 29, 2009, a total of 2155 cases of severe pneumonia, involving 821 hospitalizations and 100 deaths, were reported to the Mexican Ministry of Health. During this period, of the 8817 nasopharyngeal specimens that were submitted to the National Epidemiological Reference Laboratory, 2582 were positive for S-OIV. We compared the age distribution of patients who were reported to have severe pneumonia with that during recent influenza epidemics to document an age shift in rates of death and illness. RESULTS: During the study period, 87% of deaths and 71% of cases of severe pneumonia involved patients between the ages of 5 and 59 years, as compared with average rates of 17% and 32%, respectively, in that age group during the referent periods. Features of this epidemic were similar to those of past influenza pandemics in that circulation of the new influenza virus was associated with an off-season wave of disease affecting a younger population. CONCLUSIONS: During the early phase of this influenza pandemic, there was a sudden increase in the rate of severe pneumonia and a shift in the age distribution of patients with such illness, which was reminiscent of past pandemics and suggested relative protection for persons who were exposed to H1N1 strains during childhood before the 1957 pandemic. If resources or vaccine supplies are limited, these findings suggest a rationale for focusing prevention efforts on younger populations. Copyright 2009 Massachusetts Medical Society.},

title = {Rescinding community mitigation strategies in an influenza pandemic},
abstract = {Using a networked, agent-based computational model of a stylized community, we evaluated thresholds for rescinding 2 community mitigation strategies after an influenza pandemic. We ended child sequestering or all-community sequestering when illness incidence waned to thresholds of 0, 1, 2, or 3 cases in 7 days in 2 levels of pandemic severity. An unmitigated epidemic or strategy continuation for the epidemic duration served as control scenarios. The 0-case per 7-day rescinding threshold was comparable to the continuation strategy on infection and illness rates but reduced the number of days strategies would be needed by 6% to 32% in mild or severe pandemics. If cases recurred, strategies were resumed at a predefined 10-case trigger, and epidemic recurrence was thwarted. Strategies were most effective when used with high compliance and when combined with stringent rescinding thresholds. The need for strategies implemented for control of an influenza pandemic was reduced, without increasing illness rates.},

title = {Variation in length of hospital stay in patients with community-acquired pneumonia: are shorter stays associated with worse medical outcomes?},
abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the variation in length of stay for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia and to determine whether patients who are treated in hospitals with shorter mean stays have worse medical outcomes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We prospectively studied a cohort of 1,188 adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia who had been admitted to one community and three university teaching hospitals. We compared patients' mean length of stay, mortality, hospital readmission, return to usual activities, return to work, and pneumonia-related symptoms among the four study hospitals. All outcomes were adjusted for baseline differences in severity of illness and comorbidity. RESULTS: Adjusted interhospital differences in mean length of stay ranged from 0.9 to 2.3 days (P <0.001). When the risk of each medical outcome was compared between patients admitted to the hospital with the shortest length of stay and those admitted to longer stay hospitals, there were no differences in mortality [relative risk (RR) = 0.7; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.7], hospital readmission (RR = 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.2), return to usual activities (RR = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.3), or return to work (RR = 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8 to 2.0) during the first 14 days after discharge, or in the mean number of pneumonia-related symptoms 30 days after admission (P = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: We observed substantial interhospital variation in the lengths of stay for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. The finding that medical outcomes were similar in patients admitted to the hospital with the shortest length of stay and those admitted to hospitals with longer mean lengths of stay suggests that hospitals with longer stays may be able to reduce the mean duration of hospitalization for this disease without adversely affecting patient outcomes.},

title = {Community diversity reduces Schistosoma mansoni transmission, host pathology and human infection risk},
abstract = {Global biodiversity loss and disease emergence are two of the most challenging issues confronting science and society. Recently, observed linkages between species-loss and vector-borne infections suggest that biodiversity may help reduce pathogenic infections in humans and wildlife, but the mechanisms underlying this relationship and its applicability to a broader range of pathogens have remained speculative. Here, we experimentally evaluated the effects of host community structure on transmission of the human pathogen, Schistosoma mansoni, which alternates between snail intermediate hosts and vertebrate definitive hosts. By manipulating parasite exposure and community diversity, we show that heterospecific communities cause a 25-50 per cent reduction in infection among snail hosts (Biomphalaria glabrata). Infected snails raised alongside non-host snails (Lymnaea or Helisoma sp.) also produced 60-80 per cent fewer cercariae, suggesting that diverse communities could reduce human infection risk. Because focal host density was held constant during experiments, decreases in transmission resulted entirely from diversity-mediated pathways. Finally, the decrease in infection in mixed-species communities led to an increase in reproductive output by hosts, representing a novel example of parasite-mediated facilitation. Our results underscore the significance of community structure on transmission of complex life-cycle pathogens, and we emphasize enhanced integration between ecological and parasitological research on the diversity-disease relationship.},

title = {Is R(0) a good predictor of final epidemic size: foot-and-mouth disease in the UK},
abstract = {One of the main uses of an epidemic model is to predict the scale of an outbreak from the first few cases. In a homogeneous and non-spatial model there is a straightforward relationship between the basic reproductive ratio, R(0), and the final epidemic size; however when there is a significant spatial component to disease spread and the population is heterogeneous predicting how the epidemic size varies with the initial source of infection is far more complex. Here we use a well-developed spatio-temporal model of the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, parameterized to match the 2001 UK outbreak, to address the relationship between the scale of the epidemic and the nature of the initially infected farm. We show that there is considerable heterogeneity in both the likelihood of a epidemic and the epidemic impact (total number of farms losing livestock to either infection or control) and that these two elements are best captured by measurements at different spatial scales. The likelihood of an epidemic can be predicted from a knowledge of the reproduction ratio of the initial farm (R(i)), whereas the epidemic impact conditional on an epidemic occurring is best predicted by averaging the second-generation reproduction ratio (R(i)((2))) in a 58 km ring around the infected farm. Combining these two predictions provides a good assessment of both the local and larger-scale heterogeneities present in this complex system.},

The epizootological factors that have influenced the wide distribution of the virus are complex, and the variety of viruses currently circulating reflects these factors. Sequence analysis of the virus genes sheds light on the H5N1 virus evolution during its emergence and spread, but the degree of virus variation at the level of an individual infected bird has been described in only a few studies. Here, we describe some results of a study in which turkeys, ducks and chickens were infected with either one of two H5N1 or one of three H7N1 viruses, and the degree of sequence variation within an individual infected avian host was examined. We developed 'deep amplicon' sequence analysis for this work, and the methods and results provide a background framework for application to disease outbreaks in the field.},

title = {Decision-model estimation of the age-specific disability weight for schistosomiasis japonica: a systematic review of the literature},
abstract = {Schistosomiasis is among the most prevalent parasitic infections worldwide. However, current Global Burden of Disease (GBD) disability-adjusted life year estimates indicate that its population-level impact is negligible. Recent studies suggest that GBD methodologies may significantly underestimate the burden of parasitic diseases, including schistosomiasis. Furthermore, strain-specific disability weights have not been established for schistosomiasis, and the magnitude of human disease burden due to Schistosoma japonicum remains controversial. We used a decision model to quantify an alternative disability weight estimate of the burden of human disease due to S. japonicum. We reviewed S. japonicum morbidity data, and constructed decision trees for all infected persons and two age-specific strata, <15 years (y) and >/=15 y. We conducted stochastic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses for each model. Infection with S. japonicum was associated with an average disability weight of 0.132, with age-specific disability weights of 0.098 (<15 y) and 0.186 (>/=15 y). Re-estimated disability weights were seven to 46 times greater than current GBD measures; no simulations produced disability weight estimates lower than 0.009. Nutritional morbidities had the greatest contribution to the S. japonicum disability weight in the <15 y model, whereas major organ pathologies were the most critical variables in the older age group. GBD disability weights for schistosomiasis urgently need to be revised, and species-specific disability weights should be established. Even a marginal increase in current estimates would result in a substantial rise in the estimated global burden of schistosomiasis, and have considerable implications for public health prioritization and resource allocation for schistosomiasis research, monitoring, and control.},

We conducted a prospective cluster-randomized trial comparing surgical masks, non-fit-tested P2 masks, and no masks in prevention of influenza-like illness (ILI) in households. Mask use adherence was self-reported. During the 2006 and 2007 winter seasons, 286 exposed adults from 143 households who had been exposed to a child with clinical respiratory illness were recruited. We found that adherence to mask use significantly reduced the risk for ILI-associated infection, but <50% of participants wore masks most of the time. We concluded that household use of face masks is associated with low adherence and is ineffective for controlling seasonal respiratory disease. However, during a severe pandemic when use of face masks might be greater, pandemic transmission in households could be reduced.},

abstract = {A randomized field trial was conducted in Tecumseh, Michigan, to test the efficacy of virucidal nasal tissues in interrupting transmission of respiratory agents in the household. In the double-blinded trial, 296 households were stratified by household size and randomly assigned to the group using treated tissues and the group using placebo tissues. Households were recruited in late August to early September 1984, and the tissues were distributed in November 1984. A 10-week influenza A(H3N2) period was identified from January 13 to March 23, 1985, although there was also evidence of rhinovirus circulation during that period. A household-level infection transmission model was used to assess the effectiveness of the virucidal tissue in the household. The model was used to estimate the secondary attack rate for the placebo and treated tissue households during the influenza A(H3N2) period. The efficacy of the treated tissue in interrupting secondary transmission was found to vary from 30.1% to 36.9%, although it could be as high as 39.4% when historical comparisons are used. However, these differences were not statistically significant. In general, the use of virucidal nasal tissue in the household appears to result in the partial interruption of transmission of influenzavirus from an infected household member to another household member during an influenza epidemic.},

This ideally requires a parallel record of spatial epidemic spread and a detailed map of susceptible host density along with relevant transport links and geographical features. RESULTS: Here we analyse the most detailed such data to date arising from the UK 2001 foot and mouth epidemic. We show that Euclidean distance between infectious and susceptible premises is a better predictor of transmission risk than shortest and quickest routes via road, except where major geographical features intervene. CONCLUSION: Thus, a simple spatial transmission kernel based on Euclidean distance suffices in most regions, probably reflecting the multiplicity of transmission routes during the epidemic.},

abstract = {The paper draws together a large and scattered body of empirical evidence concerning the prevalence of snail infection with schistosome parasites in field situations, the duration of the latent period of infection in snails (and its dependence on temperature), and the mortality rates of infected and uninfected snails in field and laboratory conditions. A review and synthesis of quantitative data on the population biology of schistosome infections within the molluscan host is attempted and observed patterns of infection are compared with predictions of a schistosomiasis model developed by May (1977) which incorporates differential snail mortality (between infected and uninfected snails) and latent periods of infection. It is suggested that the low levels of prevalence within snail populations in endemic areas of schistosomiasis are closely associated with high rates of infected snail mortality and the duration of the latent period of infection within the mollusc. In certain instances, the expected life-span of an infected snail may be less than the duration of the latent period of infection. Such patterns generate very low levels of parasite prevalence. A new age prevalence model for schistosome infections within snail populations is developed and its predictions compared with observed patterns. The implications of this study of observed and predicted patterns of snail infection within molluscan populations are discussed in relation to the overall transmission dynamics of schistosomiasis.},

title = {Containing pandemic influenza at the source (SI)},
abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (subtype H5N1) is threatening to cause a human pandemic of potentially devastating proportions. We used a stochastic influenza simulation model for rural Southeast Asia to investigate the effectiveness of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, quarantine, and pre-vaccination in containing an emerging influenza strain at the source. If the basic reproductive number (R0) was below 1.60, our simulations showed that a prepared response with targeted antivirals would have a high probability of containing the disease. In that case, an antiviral agent stockpile on the order of 100,000 to 1 million courses for treatment and prophylaxis would be sufficient. If pre-vaccination occurred, then targeted antiviral prophylaxis could be effective for containing strains with an R0 as high as 2.1. Combinations of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, pre-vaccination, and quarantine could contain strains with an R(0) as high as 2.4.},

abstract = {A statistical model is presented for the analysis of infectious disease data from family studies in the community. The model partitions the sources of infection into those from within the household and those from the community at large. The parameters reflecting these sources of infection are estimated as functions of the risk factors. This new model is used to overcome problems associated with the lack of independence of observations in infectious disease data and negative confounding due to the association of unmeasured exposures and immunity. An example of how this new statistical model is used to provide a clearer and less confounded description of risk factor effects is presented for data from influenza A(H3N2) epidemic seasons in the Tecumseh Respiratory Illness Study. The risk factors examined are age and pre-epidemic season antibody level as measured by the hemagglutination-inhibition test, while the outcome is the infection rate. A standard analysis of the data indicates that the efficacy of protective antibodies is 70% in children and only 47% in adults. However, such an efficacy measurement is negatively confounded by past exposure which is age dependent. By means of the model, the true, unconfounded, efficacy of protective antibodies is shown to be 90% in both adults and children.},

title = {Epidemiological determinants of spread of causal agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health authorities worldwide, especially in the Asia Pacific region, are seeking effective public-health interventions in the continuing epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We assessed the epidemiology of SARS in Hong Kong. METHODS: We included 1425 cases reported up to April 28, 2003. An integrated database was constructed from several sources containing information on epidemiological, demographic, and clinical variables. We estimated the key epidemiological distributions: infection to onset, onset to admission, admission to death, and admission to discharge. We measured associations between the estimated case fatality rate and patients' age and the time from onset to admission. FINDINGS: After the initial phase of exponential growth, the rate of confirmed cases fell to less than 20 per day by April 28. Public-health interventions included encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantining, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts. The mean incubation period of the disease is estimated to be 6.4 days (95% CI 5.2-7.7). The mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic. The estimated case fatality rate was 13.2% (9.8-16.8) for patients younger than 60 years and 43.3% (35.2-52.4) for patients aged 60 years or older assuming a parametric gamma distribution. A non-parametric method yielded estimates of 6.8% (4.0-9.6) and 55.0% (45.3-64.7), respectively. Case clusters have played an important part in the course of the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Patients' age was strongly associated with outcome. The time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital did not alter outcome, but shorter intervals will be important to the wider population by restricting the infectious period before patients are placed in quarantine.},

title = {Containing bioterrorist smallpox},
abstract = {The need for a planned response to a deliberate introduction of smallpox has recently become urgent. We constructed a stochastic simulator of the spread of smallpox in structured communities to compare the effectiveness of mass vaccination versus targeted vaccination of close contacts of cases. Mass vaccination before smallpox introduction or immediately after the first cases was more effective than targeted vaccination in preventing and containing epidemics if there was no prior herd immunity (that is, no prior immunologic protection within the population). The effectiveness of postrelease targeted and mass vaccinations increased if we assumed that there was residual immunity in adults vaccinated before 1972, but the effectiveness of targeted vaccination increased more than that of mass vaccination. Under all scenarios, targeted vaccination prevented more cases per dose of vaccine than did mass vaccination. Although further research with larger-scale structured models is needed, our results suggest that increasing herd immunity, perhaps with a combination of preemptive voluntary vaccination and vaccination of first responders, could enhance the effectiveness of postattack intervention. It could also help targeted vaccination be more competitive with mass vaccination at both preventing and containing a deliberate introduction of smallpox.},

abstract = {H9N2 influenza viruses have become established in terrestrial poultry in different Asian countries over the last 2 decades. Our previous study demonstrated that quail harbor increasingly diverse novel H9N2 reassortants, including both Chicken/Beijing/1/94 (Ck/Bei-like) and Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (G1-like) viruses. However, since 1999, the genesis and evolution of H9N2 viruses in different types of poultry have not been investigated systematically. In the present study, H9N2 viruses isolated from chickens, ducks, and other minor poultry species were characterized genetically and antigenically. Our findings demonstrate that Ck/Bei-like H9N2 viruses have been introduced into many different types of poultry in southern China, including quail, partridges, chukar, pheasant, guinea fowl, and domestic ducks, while G1-like viruses were commonly detected in quail, less frequently detected in other minor poultry species, and not detected in chickens and ducks. Genetic analysis revealed 35 genotypes of H9N2 viruses, including 14 novel genotypes that have not been recognized before. Our results also suggested that two-way interspecies transmission exists between different types of poultry. Our study demonstrates that the long-term cocirculation of multiple virus lineages (e.g., H5N1 and H9N2 viruses) in different types of poultry has facilitated the frequent reassortment events that are mostly responsible for the current great genetic diversity in H9N2 and H5N1 influenza viruses in this region. This situation favors the emergence of influenza viruses with pandemic potential.},

abstract = {Recently many investigators have used microsatellite DNA loci for studying the evolutionary relationships of closely related populations or species, and some authors proposed new genetic distance measures for this purpose. However, the efficiencies of these distance measures in obtaining the correct tree topology remains unclear. We therefore investigated the probability of obtaining the correct topology (PC) for these new distances as well as traditional distance measures by using computer simulation. We used both the infinite-allele model (IAM) and the stepwise mutation model (SMM), which seem to be appropriate for classical markers and microsatellite loci, respectively. The results show that in both the IAM and SMM CAVALLI-SFORZA and EDWARDS' chord distance (DC) and NEI et al.'s DA distance generally show higher PC values than other distance measures, whether the bottleneck effect exists or not. For estimating evolutionary times, however, NEI's standard distance and GOLDSTEIN et al.'s (delta mu)2 are more appropriate than other distances. Microsatellite DNA seems to be very useful for clarifying the evolutionary relationships of closely related populations.},

title = {The annual impact of seasonal influenza in the US: measuring disease burden and costs},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite preventive efforts, influenza epidemics are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality every year in the United States (US). Vaccination strategies to reduce disease burden have been implemented. However, no previous studies have systematically estimated the annual economic burden of influenza epidemics, an estimate necessary to guide policy makers effectively. OBJECTIVE: We estimate age- and risk-specific disease burden, and medical and indirect costs attributable to annual influenza epidemics in the United States. METHODS: Using a probabilistic model and publicly available epidemiological data we estimated the number of influenza-attributable cases leading to outpatient visits, hospitalization, and mortality, as well as time lost from work absenteeism or premature death. With data from health insurance claims and projections of either earnings or statistical life values, we then estimated healthcare resource utilization associated with influenza cases as were their medical and productivity (indirect) costs in {\$}2003. RESULTS: Based on 2003 US population, we estimated that annual influenza epidemics resulted in an average of 610,660 life-years lost (undiscounted), 3.1 million hospitalized days, and 31.4 million outpatient visits. Direct medical costs averaged {\$}10.4 billion (95% confidence interval [C.I.], {\$}4.1, {\$}22.2) annually. Projected lost earnings due to illness and loss of life amounted to {\$}16.3 billion (C.I., {\$}8.7, {\$}31.0) annually. The total economic burden of annual influenza epidemics using projected statistical life values amounted to {\$}87.1 billion (C.I., {\$}47.2, {\$}149.5). CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the enormous annual burden of influenza in the US. While hospitalization costs are important contributors, lost productivity from missed work days and lost lives comprise the bulk of the economic burden of influenza.},

title = {Influenza vaccination coverage among children and adults - United States, 2008-09 influenza season},
abstract = {Before 2008, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) had recommended annual vaccination for influenza for persons aged >or=50 years, 18-49 years at higher risk for influenza complications, and 6 months--4 years. In 2008, ACIP expanded the recommendations to include all children aged 5--18 years, beginning with the 2008--09 season, if feasible, but no later than the 2009--10 season. This expansion added 26 million children and adolescents to groups recommended for routine influenza vaccination. To assess vaccination uptake among children and adults during the 2008-09 influenza season, CDC analyzed data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in 19 states, which represent 43% of the U.S. population. This report summarizes the results of the analysis, which indicated that reported influenza vaccination coverage of >or=1 doses was 40.9% for ages 6-23 months, 32.0% for 2-4 years, and 20.8% for 5-17 years. Among adults, reported coverage was 32.1% for persons aged 18--49 years with high-risk conditions, 42.3% for persons 50--64 years, and 67.2% for persons >or=65 years. These results are consistent with previous studies that have found no significant increases in vaccination coverage for any of these age groups over previous seasons.

abstract = {Avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses cause severe disease in humans, but the basis for their virulence remains unclear. In vitro and animal studies indicate that high and disseminated viral replication is important for disease pathogenesis. Laboratory experiments suggest that virus-induced cytokine dysregulation may contribute to disease severity. To assess the relevance of these findings for human disease, we performed virological and immunological studies in 18 individuals with H5N1 and 8 individuals infected with human influenza virus subtypes. Influenza H5N1 infection in humans is characterized by high pharyngeal virus loads and frequent detection of viral RNA in rectum and blood. Viral RNA in blood was present only in fatal H5N1 cases and was associated with higher pharyngeal viral loads. We observed low peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts and high chemokine and cytokine levels in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died, and these correlated with pharyngeal viral loads. Genetic characterization of H5N1 viruses revealed mutations in the viral polymerase complex associated with mammalian adaptation and virulence. Our observations indicate that high viral load, and the resulting intense inflammatory responses, are central to influenza H5N1 pathogenesis. The focus of clinical management should be on preventing this intense cytokine response, by early diagnosis and effective antiviral treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis japonica is a chronic helminthic infection contracted through contact with water infested with Schistosoma japonicum. The infection is associated with severe disease and is an important public health concern in Philippines. OBJECT: To estimate the agreement in the frequency of water contact between bimonthly interviews, self-administered diaries and observations. METHODS: A total of 286 individuals were followed over either a 4 or a 6 months period. Agreement between direct observation and both the bimonthly and diary methods were estimated. RESULTS: The agreement between the observation and the bimonthly interview was 71.8% when days without any water contacts were considered, but decreased to 23.3% when only days with at least some water contact were considered. The agreement between the observation and the diary was 78.7% when days without any water contacts were considered and 40.8% when only days with some water contacts were considered. CONCLUSIONS: Agreement about the degree of water contact is poor between the different measurement tools. This has important implications for future research, since a high degree of measurement error can severely bias any results from studies involving water contact.},

title = {The effect of public health measures on the 1918 influenza pandemic in U.S. cities},
abstract = {During the 1918 influenza pandemic, the U.S., unlike Europe, put considerable effort into public health interventions. There was also more geographic variation in the autumn wave of the pandemic in the U.S. compared with Europe, with some cities seeing only a single large peak in mortality and others seeing double-peaked epidemics. Here we examine whether differences in the public health measures adopted by different cities can explain the variation in epidemic patterns and overall mortality observed. We show that city-specific per-capita excess mortality in 1918 was significantly correlated with 1917 per-capita mortality, indicating some intrinsic variation in overall mortality, perhaps related to sociodemographic factors. In the subset of 23 cities for which we had partial data on the timing of interventions, an even stronger correlation was found between excess mortality and how early in the epidemic interventions were introduced. We then fitted an epidemic model to weekly mortality in 16 cities with nearly complete intervention-timing data and estimated the impact of interventions. The model reproduced the observed epidemic patterns well. In line with theoretical arguments, we found the time-limited interventions used reduced total mortality only moderately (perhaps 10-30%), and that the impact was often very limited because of interventions being introduced too late and lifted too early. San Francisco, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Kansas City had the most effective interventions, reducing transmission rates by up to 30-50%. Our analysis also suggests that individuals reactively reduced their contact rates in response to high levels of mortality during the pandemic.},

abstract = {At the outset of an influenza pandemic, early estimates of the number of secondary cases generated by a primary influenza case (reproduction number, R) and its associated uncertainty can help determine the intensity of interventions necessary for control. Using a compartmental model and hospital notification data of the first two waves of the Spanish flu pandemic in Geneva, Switzerland in 1918, we estimate the reproduction number from the early phase of the pandemic waves. For the spring and fall pandemic waves, we estimate reproduction numbers of 1:57 (95% CI: 1:45, 1:70) and 3:10 (2:81, 3:39), respectively, from the initial epidemic phase comprising the first 10 epidemic days of the corresponding wave. Estimates of the variance of our point estimates of R were computed via a parametric bootstrap. We compare these estimates with others obtained using different observation windows to provide insight into how early into an epidemic the reproduction number can be estimated.},

OBJECTIVES: To prepare laboratories for surge capacity for molecular diagnosis of patients suspected for A(H1N1)v infection in the Netherlands. STUDY DESIGN: A panel of 10 blinded specimens containing seasonal A(H1N1) or A(H3N2), or A/Netherlands/602/2009(H1N1)v influenza virus, or negative control was distributed to the outbreak assistance laboratories (OAL) together with influenza virus A (M-gene), swine influenza virus A (NP-gene) and influenza virus A(H1N1)v (H1v-gene) specific primers and probes and protocol (CDC Atlanta, USA). Laboratories were asked to implement and test this protocol. RESULTS: All OAL were able to detect A(H1N1)v using the CDC M-gene reagents, the majority with similar sensitivity as the in-house M-gene based assays. RT-PCRs used in routine diagnostic setting in the OAL specifically designed to detect H1, H3, or NS1 from seasonal influenza A viruses, did not or at very low level cross-react with A(H1N1)v. The CDC swine NP-gene and H1v-gene RT-PCRs showed somewhat reduced sensitivity compared to the CDC and in-house M-gene RT-PCRs. In contrast, in-house developed A(H1N1)v specific H1v-gene and N1v-gene RT-PCRs showed equal sensitivity to CDC and in-house M-gene RT-PCRs. CONCLUSIONS: The Dutch OAL are prepared for detection and specific identification of A(H1N1)v, although some level of cross-reactivity was observed with seasonal influenza viruses. Additionally, M-gene based generic influenza A virus detection is recommended to be able to detect emerging influenza A viruses in routine settings.},

title = {Antiviral resistance and the control of pandemic influenza},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The response to the next influenza pandemic will likely include extensive use of antiviral drugs (mainly oseltamivir), combined with other transmission-reducing measures. Animal and in vitro studies suggest that some strains of influenza may become resistant to oseltamivir while maintaining infectiousness (fitness). Use of antiviral agents on the scale anticipated for the control of pandemic influenza will create an unprecedented selective pressure for the emergence and spread of these strains. Nonetheless, antiviral resistance has received little attention when evaluating these plans. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We designed and analyzed a deterministic compartmental model of the transmission of oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant influenza infections during a pandemic. The model predicts that even if antiviral treatment or prophylaxis leads to the emergence of a transmissible resistant strain in as few as 1 in 50,000 treated persons and 1 in 500,000 prophylaxed persons, widespread use of antivirals may strongly promote the spread of resistant strains at the population level, leading to a prevalence of tens of percent by the end of a pandemic. On the other hand, even in circumstances in which a resistant strain spreads widely, the use of antivirals may significantly delay and/or reduce the total size of the pandemic. If resistant strains carry some fitness cost, then, despite widespread emergence of resistance, antivirals could slow pandemic spread by months or more, and buy time for vaccine development; this delay would be prolonged by nondrug control measures (e.g., social distancing) that reduce transmission, or use of a stockpiled suboptimal vaccine. Surprisingly, the model suggests that such nondrug control measures would increase the proportion of the epidemic caused by resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of antiviral drug use to control an influenza pandemic may be reduced, although not completely offset, by drug resistance in the virus. Therefore, the risk of resistance should be considered in pandemic planning and monitored closely during a pandemic.},

title = {Update: swine influenza A (H1N1) infections--California and Texas, April 2009},
abstract = {On April 21, 2009, CDC reported that two recent cases of febrile respiratory illness in children in southern California had been caused by infection with genetically similar swine influenza A (H1N1) viruses. The viruses contained a unique combination of gene segments that had not been reported previously among swine or human influenza viruses in the United States or elsewhere. Neither child had known contact with pigs, resulting in concern that human-to-human transmission might have occurred. The seasonal influenza vaccine H1N1 strain is thought to be unlikely to provide protection. This report updates the status of the ongoing investigation and provides preliminary details about six additional persons infected by the same strain of swine influenza A (H1N1) virus identified in the previous cases, as of April 24. The six additional cases were reported in San Diego County, California (three cases), Imperial County, California (one case), and Guadalupe County, Texas (two cases). CDC, the California Department of Public Health, and the Texas Department of Health and Human Services are conducting case investigations, monitoring for illness in contacts of the eight patients, and enhancing surveillance to determine the extent of spread of the virus. CDC continues to recommend that any influenza A viruses that cannot be subtyped be sent promptly for testing to CDC. In addition, swine influenza A (H1N1) viruses of the same strain as those in the U.S. patients have been confirmed by CDC among specimens from patients in Mexico. Clinicians should consider swine influenza as well as seasonal influenza virus infections in the differential diagnosis for patients who have febrile respiratory illness and who 1) live in San Diego and Imperial counties, California, or Guadalupe County, Texas, or traveled to these counties or 2) who traveled recently to Mexico or were in contact with persons who had febrile respiratory illness and were in one of the three U.S. counties or Mexico during the 7 days preceding their illness onset.},

title = {Emergence of drug resistance during an influenza epidemic: insights from a mathematical model},
abstract = {A model was developed for the emergence of drug-resistant influenza viruses during a closed population influenza epidemic that occurs in a single wave. The model was used to consider several treatment and chemoprophylaxis strategies and to determine their effects on the spread of the infection. The model predicts frequent emergence and transmission of drug-resistant viruses with certain treatment scenarios. According to the model, chemoprophylaxis of susceptible persons (without treatment of those who are symptomatic) may be the best way to reduce the force of an epidemic and to keep development of drug resistance low. The model predictions indicate that the relative transmissibility of resistant variants compared with wild type virus and the choice of the treatment or chemoprophylaxis strategy can be decisive for the spread of drug-resistant viruses, a feature that may be crucial in a pandemic.},

In the early phases of a pandemic, the only treatment available would be neuraminidase inhibitors, which many countries are considering stockpiling for pandemic use. We estimate the effect on hospitalization rates of using different antiviral stockpile sizes to treat infection. We estimate that stockpiles that cover 20%-25% of the population would be sufficient to treat most of the clinical cases and could lead to 50% to 77% reductions in hospitalizations. Substantial reductions in hospitalization could be achieved with smaller antiviral stockpiles if drugs are reserved for persons at high risk.},

title = {Neuraminidase inhibitors for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in children: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir in treatment of children with seasonal influenza and prevention of transmission to children in households. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of data from published and unpublished randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: Medline and Embase to June 2009, trial registries, and manufacturers and authors of relevant studies. Review methods Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials of neuraminidase inhibitors in children aged </=12 in the community (that is, not admitted to hospital) with confirmed or clinically suspected influenza. Primary outcome measures were time to resolution of illness and incidence of influenza in children living in households with index cases of influenza. RESULTS: We identified four randomised trials of treatment of influenza (two with oseltamivir, two with zanamivir) involving 1766 children (1243 with confirmed influenza, of whom 55-69% had influenza A), and three randomised trials for postexposure prophylaxis (one with oseltamivir, two with zanamivir) involving 863 children; none of these trials tested efficacy with the current pandemic strain. Treatment trials showed reductions in median time to resolution of symptoms or return to normal activities, or both, of 0.5-1.5 days, which were significant in only two trials. A 10 day course of postexposure prophylaxis with zanamivir or oseltamivir resulted in an 8% (95% confidence interval 5% to 12%) decrease in the incidence of symptomatic influenza. Based on only one trial, oseltamivir did not reduce asthma exacerbations or improve peak flow in children with asthma. Treatment was not associated with reduction in overall use of antibiotics (risk difference -0.30, -0.13 to 0.01). Zanamivir was well tolerated, but oseltamivir was associated with an increased risk of vomiting (0.05, 0.02 to 0.09, number needed to harm=20). CONCLUSIONS: Neuraminidase inhibitors provide a small benefit by shortening the duration of illness in children with seasonal influenza and reducing household transmission. They have little effect on asthma exacerbations or the use of antibiotics. Their effects on the incidence of serious complications, and on the current A/H1N1 influenza strain remain to be determined.},

title = {Virologically confirmed population-based burden of hospitalization caused by influenza A and B among children in Hong Kong},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the virologically confirmed hospitalization rates associated with influenza virus infection among Hong Kong children. METHODS: Patients <18 years of age who lived on Hong Kong Island (a separate island within Hong Kong) and were admitted to either of the only 2 public hospitals on the island for a febrile acute respiratory infection on 1 fixed day of the week in each hospital from October 2003 through September 2006 were prospectively recruited. These 2 hospitals together accounted for 72.5% of all general pediatric admissions in Hong Kong Island with a known population denominator. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from all recruited patients and were tested for influenza A and influenza B viruses by direct antigen detection and culture. RESULTS: All cases of influenza A during 2003-2004 were caused by H3N2 virus, whereas 85.7% of cases during 2004-2005 were due to H3N2 virus, and 93.5% during 2005-2006 were due to H1N1 virus. During 2004-2005, infants <1 year of age had the highest rate of hospitalization for influenza A (103.8 cases per 10,000 population), whereas children 1 year of age had the highest rate of hospitalization during the other 2 seasons (95.5 and 54.6 cases per 10,000 population during 2003-2004 and 2005-2006, respectively). A protection rate of 25%, presumably attributable to maternal antibodies, was seen in infants <1 year of age who were hospitalized during 2003-2004 with infection due to an H3N2 virus that had been in circulation. The hospitalization rates for influenza B were highest among children 2-4 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study of hospitalizations due to virologically confirmed influenza demonstrated a very high burden of disease among young children in Hong Kong. The morbidity varied with virus type, subtype, and antigenic variants.},

title = {Mathematical modelling of schistosomiasis japonica: comparison of control strategies in the People's Republic of China},
abstract = {We present the first mathematical model on the transmission dynamics of Schistosoma japonicum. The work extends Barbour's classic model of schistosome transmission. It allows for the mammalian host heterogeneity characteristic of the S. japonicum life cycle, and solves the problem of under-specification of Barbour's model by the use of Chinese data we are collecting on human-bovine transmission in the Poyang Lake area of Jiangxi Province in China. The model predicts that in the lake/marshland areas of the Yangtze River basin: (1) once-yearly mass chemotherapy of humans is little better than twice-yearly mass chemotherapy in reducing human prevalence. Depending on the heterogeneity of prevalence within the population, targeted treatment of high prevalence groups, with lower overall coverage, can be more effective than mass treatment with higher overall coverage. Treatment confers a short term benefit only, with prevalence rising to endemic levels once chemotherapy programs are stopped; (2) depending on the relative contributions of bovines and humans, bovine treatment can benefit humans almost as much as human treatment. Like human treatment, bovine treatment confers a short-term benefit. A combination of human and bovine treatment will dramatically reduce human prevalence and maintains the reduction for a longer period of time than treatment of a single host, although human prevalence rises once treatment ceases; (3) assuming 75% coverage of bovines, a bovine vaccine which acts on worm fecundity must have about 75% efficacy to reduce the reproduction rate below one and ensure mid-term reduction and long-term elimination of the parasite. Such a vaccination program should be accompanied by an initial period of human treatment to instigate a short-term reduction in prevalence, following which the reduction is enhanced by vaccine effects; (4) if the bovine vaccine is only 45% efficacious (the level of current prototype vaccines) it will lower the endemic prevalence, but will not result in elimination. If it is accompanied by an initial period of human treatment and by a 45% improvement in human sanitation or a 30% reduction in contaminated water contact by humans, elimination is then possible.},

However, systematic analysis of their interrelationship and the development of genetic diversity have not been explored. As each of those reassortants was first detected in China, here 318 full-length H5N1 virus genomes isolated from 1996 to 2006 in this region were phylogenetically analyzed. Our findings revealed two major group reassortment events in 2001 and 2002 that were responsible for the generation of the majority of the 44 distinct Gs/GD genotypes identified, excepting those 1997 variants. Genotype replacement and emergence occurred continually, with 34 transient genotypes detected while only 10 variants were persistent. Two major replacements of predominant genotypes were also observed: genotype B replaced by Z in 2002 and then genotype Z replaced by the now predominant genotype V in 2005.},

abstract = {A better understanding of transmission dynamics is essential in influenza pandemic planning. If a substantial proportion of transmissions were to occur during the presymptomatic phase or from asymptomatic individuals, then infection control measures such as contact tracing and quarantine of exposures would be of limited value. Infectiousness has been inferred based on the presence of influenza in the upper respiratory tract rather than from transmission experiments. Although asymptomatic individuals may shed influenza virus, studies have not determined if such people effectively transmit influenza. We performed a systematic review of published studies describing the relationship between viral shedding and disease transmission. Based on the available literature, we found that there is scant, if any, evidence that asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals play an important role in influenza transmission. As such, recent articles concerning pandemic planning, some using transmission modeling, may have overestimated the effect of presymptomatic or asymptomatic influenza transmission. More definitive transmission studies are sorely needed.},

To make progress in this direction, we designed several mathematical models and compared them with data from influenza A infections of mice.

In contrast, regrowth of epithelial cells did not seem to be an important mechanism on the time scale of the infection. We also find that different model variants for both innate and adaptive responses fit the data well, indicating the need for additional data to allow further model discrimination.},

abstract = {William Beaumont Army Medical Center conducted quantitative modeling with FluSurge 2.0 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to determine hospital capabilities in responding to patient arrival surges of the Fort Bliss population in mild 1968-type and severe 1918-type influenza pandemics. Model predictions showed that William Beaumont Army Medical Center could adequately care for all intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients during a mild pandemic, particularly if hospital capacity was expanded using the emergency management plan, excess surge plan, or activation of a contagious disease outbreak facility. For a severe influenza pandemic, model predictions showed that hospital beds, ventilators, and other resources would be exceeded within 2 or 3 weeks. Even at maximal hospital expansion, for a 12-week severe pandemic with a 35% attack rate there would be peak demand for 214% of available non-ICU beds, 785% of ICU beds, and 392% of ventilators. Health care planners and decision-makers should prepare for resource challenges when developing plans for the next influenza pandemic.},

title = {Modeling the worldwide spread of pandemic influenza: baseline case and containment interventions},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, which is now widespread in Southeast Asia and which diffused recently in some areas of the Balkans region and Western Europe, has raised a public alert toward the potential occurrence of a new severe influenza pandemic. Here we study the worldwide spread of a pandemic and its possible containment at a global level taking into account all available information on air travel. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied a metapopulation stochastic epidemic model on a global scale that considers airline travel flow data among urban areas. We provided a temporal and spatial evolution of the pandemic with a sensitivity analysis of different levels of infectiousness of the virus and initial outbreak conditions (both geographical and seasonal). For each spreading scenario we provided the timeline and the geographical impact of the pandemic in 3,100 urban areas, located in 220 different countries. We compared the baseline cases with different containment strategies, including travel restrictions and the therapeutic use of antiviral (AV) drugs. We investigated the effect of the use of AV drugs in the event that therapeutic protocols can be carried out with maximal coverage for the populations in all countries. In view of the wide diversity of AV stockpiles in different regions of the world, we also studied scenarios in which only a limited number of countries are prepared (i.e., have considerable AV supplies). In particular, we compared different plans in which, on the one hand, only prepared and wealthy countries benefit from large AV resources, with, on the other hand, cooperative containment scenarios in which countries with large AV stockpiles make a small portion of their supplies available worldwide. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the inclusion of air transportation is crucial in the assessment of the occurrence probability of global outbreaks. The large-scale therapeutic usage of AV drugs in all hit countries would be able to mitigate a pandemic effect with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9 during the first year; with AV supply use sufficient to treat approximately 2% to 6% of the population, in conjunction with efficient case detection and timely drug distribution. For highly contagious viruses (i.e., a reproductive rate as high as 2.3), even the unrealistic use of supplies corresponding to the treatment of approximately 20% of the population leaves 30%-50% of the population infected. In the case of limited AV supplies and pandemics with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9, we demonstrate that the more cooperative the strategy, the more effective are the containment results in all regions of the world, including those countries that made part of their resources available for global use.},

title = {Optimal observation times in experimental epidemic processes},
abstract = {This article describes a method for choosing observation times for  stochastic processes to maximise the expected information about their  parameters. Two commonly used models for epidemiological processes are  considered: a simple death process and a susceptible-infected (SI)  epidemic process with dual sources for infection spreading within and  from outwith the population. The search for the optimal design uses  Bayesian computational methods to explore the joint  parameter-data-design space, combined with a method known as moment  closure to approximate the likelihood to make the acceptance step  efficient. For the processes considered, a small number of optimally  chosen observations are shown to yield almost as much information as  much more intensively observed schemes that are commonly used in  epidemiological experiments. Analysis of the simple death process  allows a comparison between the full Bayesian approach and locally  optimal designs around a point estimate from the prior based on  asymptotic results. The robustness of the approach to misspecified  priors is demonstrated for the SI epidemic process, for which the  computational intractability of the likelihood precludes locally  optimal designs. We show that optimal designs derived by the Bayesian  approach are similar for observational studies of a single epidemic and  for studies involving replicated epidemics in independent  subpopulations. Different optima result, however, when the objective is  to maximise the gain in information based on informative and  non-informative priors: this has implications when an experiment is  designed to convince a naive or sceptical observer rather than  consolidate the belief of an informed observer. Some extensions to the  methods, including the selection of information criteria and extension  to other epidemic processes with transition probabilities, are briefly  addressed.},

title = {Modelling vaccination strategies against foot-and-mouth disease},
abstract = {Vaccination has proved a powerful defence against a range of infectious diseases of humans and animals. However, its potential to control major epidemics of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in livestock is contentious. Using an individual farm-based model, we consider either national prophylactic vaccination campaigns in advance of an outbreak, or combinations of reactive vaccination and culling strategies during an epidemic. Consistent with standard epidemiological theory, mass prophylactic vaccination could reduce greatly the potential for a major epidemic, while the targeting of high-risk farms increases efficiency. Given sufficient resources and preparation, a combination of reactive vaccination and culling might control ongoing epidemics. We also explore a reactive strategy, 'predictive' vaccination, which targets key spatial transmission loci and can reduce markedly the long tail that characterizes many FMD epidemics. These analyses have broader implications for the control of human and livestock infectious diseases in heterogeneous spatial landscapes.},

title = {Modelling foot-and-mouth disease: a comparison between the UK and Denmark},
abstract = {Whilst the UK 2001 FMD (foot-and-mouth disease) outbreak provides an extremely rich source of spatio-temporal epidemic data, it is not clear how the models and parameters from the UK can be translated to other scenarios. Here we consider how the model framework used to capture the UK epidemic can be applied to a hypothetical FMD outbreak in Denmark. Whilst pigs played a relatively minor role in the UK epidemic (being the infected animal on just 18 farms), they dominate the Danish livestock landscape. In addition, it is not clear whether transmission parameters from the UK will transfer to Denmark where farming practices may be significantly different. We therefore explore a large volume of high-dimensional parameter space, but seek to relate final epidemic size, risk of spread to Danish islands and potential success of control measures, to early indicators of epidemic dynamics. The results of this extensive modelling exercise therefore allow us to provide timely advice on control options based on the observed behaviours of the first few generations.},

abstract = {The dynamics of viral shedding and symptoms following influenza virus infection are key factors when considering epidemic control measures. The authors reviewed published studies describing the course of influenza virus infection in placebo-treated and untreated volunteers challenged with wild-type influenza virus. A total of 56 different studies with 1,280 healthy participants were considered. Viral shedding increased sharply between 0.5 and 1 day after challenge and consistently peaked on day 2. The duration of viral shedding averaged over 375 participants was 4.80 days (95% confidence interval: 4.31, 5.29). The frequency of symptomatic infection was 66.9% (95% confidence interval: 58.3, 74.5). Fever was observed in 37.0% of A/H1N1, 40.6% of A/H3N2 (p = 0.86), and 7.5% of B infections (p = 0.001). The total symptoms scores increased on day 1 and peaked on day 3. Systemic symptoms peaked on day 2. No such data exist for children or elderly subjects, but epidemiologic studies suggest that the natural history might differ. The present analysis confirms prior expert opinion on the duration of viral shedding or the frequency of asymptomatic influenza infection, extends prior knowledge on the dynamics of viral shedding and symptoms, and provides original results on the frequency of respiratory symptoms or fever.},

title = {Neuraminidase inhibitor resistance in influenza: assessing the danger of its generation and spread},
abstract = {Neuraminidase Inhibitors (NI) are currently the most effective drugs against influenza. Recent cases of NI resistance are a cause for concern. To assess the danger of NI resistance, a number of studies have reported the fraction of treated patients from which resistant strains could be isolated. Unfortunately, those results strongly depend on the details of the experimental protocol. Additionally, knowing the fraction of patients harboring resistance is not too useful by itself. Instead, we want to know how likely it is that an infected patient can generate a resistant infection in a secondary host, and how likely it is that the resistant strain subsequently spreads. While estimates for these parameters can often be obtained from epidemiological data, such data is lacking for NI resistance in influenza. Here, we use an approach that does not rely on epidemiological data. Instead, we combine data from influenza infections of human volunteers with a mathematical framework that allows estimation of the parameters that govern the initial generation and subsequent spread of resistance. We show how these parameters are influenced by changes in drug efficacy, timing of treatment, fitness of the resistant strain, and details of virus and immune system dynamics. Our study provides estimates for parameters that can be directly used in mathematical and computational models to study how NI usage might lead to the emergence and spread of resistance in the population. We find that the initial generation of resistant cases is most likely lower than the fraction of resistant cases reported. However, we also show that the results depend strongly on the details of the within-host dynamics of influenza infections, and most importantly, the role the immune system plays. Better knowledge of the quantitative dynamics of the immune response during influenza infections will be crucial to further improve the results.},

The lack of similarity between the 2009 A(H1N1) virus and its nearest relatives indicates that its gene segments have been circulating undetected for an extended period. Its low genetic diversity suggests the introduction into humans was a single event or multiple events of similar viruses. Molecular markers predictive of adaptation to humans are not currently present in 2009 A(H1N1) viruses, suggesting previously unrecognized molecular determinants could be responsible for the transmission among humans. Antigenically the viruses are homogeneous and similar to North American swine A(H1N1) viruses but distinct from seasonal human A(H1N1).},

title = {Contact rate calculation for a basic epidemic model},
abstract = {Mass-action epidemic models are the foundation of the majority of studies of disease dynamics in human and animal populations. Here, a kinetic model of mobile susceptible and infective individuals in a two-dimensional domain is introduced, and an examination of the contact process results in a mass-action-like term for the generation of new infectives. The conditions under which density dependent and frequency dependent transmission terms emerge are clarified. Moreover, this model suggests that epidemics in large mobile spatially distributed populations can be well described by homogeneously mixing mass-action models. The analysis generates an analytic formula for the contact rate (beta) and the basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) of an infectious pathogen, which contains a mixture of demographic and epidemiological parameters. The analytic results are compared with a simulation and are shown to give good agreement. The simulation permits the exploration of more realistic movement strategies and their consequent effect on epidemic dynamics.},

title = {Swine influenza A (H1N1) infection in two children--Southern California, March-April 2009},
abstract = {On April 17, 2009, CDC determined that two cases of febrile respiratory illness occurring in children who resided in adjacent counties in southern California were caused by infection with a swine influenza A (H1N1) virus. The viruses from the two cases are closely related genetically, resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, and contain a unique combination of gene segments that previously has not been reported among swine or human influenza viruses in the United States or elsewhere. Neither child had contact with pigs; the source of the infection is unknown. Investigations to identify the source of infection and to determine whether additional persons have been ill from infection with similar swine influenza viruses are ongoing. This report briefly describes the two cases and the investigations currently under way. Although this is not a new subtype of influenza A in humans, concern exists that this new strain of swine influenza A (H1N1) is substantially different from human influenza A (H1N1) viruses, that a large proportion of the population might be susceptible to infection, and that the seasonal influenza vaccine H1N1 strain might not provide protection. The lack of known exposure to pigs in the two cases increases the possibility that human-to-human transmission of this new influenza virus has occurred. Clinicians should consider animal as well as seasonal influenza virus infections in their differential diagnosis of patients who have febrile respiratory illness and who 1) live in San Diego and Imperial counties or 2) traveled to these counties or were in contact with ill persons from these counties in the 7 days preceding their illness onset, or 3) had recent exposure to pigs. Clinicians who suspect swine influenza virus infections in a patient should obtain a respiratory specimen and contact their state or local health department to facilitate testing at a state public health laboratory.},

During the second phase, there were 5363 person-years of observation. Respiratory illness rates in both males and females peaked in the 1-2 year age group and fell thereafter. Adult females had more frequent illnesses than adult males; illnesses were less common in working women than in women not working outside the home. Isolation of viruses fell with increasing age; rhinoviruses were the most common isolate. Influenza infection rates, determined serologically, suggested relative sparing of young children from infection with type A (H1N1) and type B. Infection rates were highest in adult age groups for type A (H3N2). The isolation and serological infection rates were used to estimate the extent to which laboratory procedures underestimated the proportion of respiratory illnesses caused by each infectious agent; data from other studies were also used in this estimation. Severity of respiratory illnesses was assessed by the proportion of such illnesses that resulted in consultation of a physician. Rhinoviruses produced the greatest number of consultations. Overall, physician consultations were associated with 25.4% of respiratory illnesses.},

title = {A 'small-world-like' model for comparing interventions aimed at preventing and controlling influenza pandemics},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: With an influenza pandemic seemingly imminent, we constructed a model simulating the spread of influenza within the community, in order to test the impact of various interventions. METHODS: The model includes an individual level, in which the risk of influenza virus infection and the dynamics of viral shedding are simulated according to age, treatment, and vaccination status; and a community level, in which meetings between individuals are simulated on randomly generated graphs. We used data on real pandemics to calibrate some parameters of the model. The reference scenario assumes no vaccination, no use of antiviral drugs, and no preexisting herd immunity. We explored the impact of interventions such as vaccination, treatment/prophylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors, quarantine, and closure of schools or workplaces. RESULTS: In the reference scenario, 57% of realizations lead to an explosive outbreak, lasting a mean of 82 days (standard deviation (SD) 12 days) and affecting 46.8% of the population on average. Interventions aimed at reducing the number of meetings, combined with measures reducing individual transmissibility, would be partly effective: coverage of 70% of affected households, with treatment of the index patient, prophylaxis of household contacts, and confinement to home of all household members, would reduce the probability of an outbreak by 52%, and the remaining outbreaks would be limited to 17% of the population (range 0.8%-25%). Reactive vaccination of 70% of the susceptible population would significantly reduce the frequency, size, and mean duration of outbreaks, but the benefit would depend markedly on the interval between identification of the first case and the beginning of mass vaccination. The epidemic would affect 4% of the population if vaccination started immediately, 17% if there was a 14-day delay, and 36% if there was a 28-day delay. Closing schools when the number of infections in the community exceeded 50 would be very effective, limiting the size of outbreaks to 10% of the population (range 0.9%-22%). CONCLUSION: This flexible tool can help to determine the interventions most likely to contain an influenza pandemic. These results support the stockpiling of antiviral drugs and accelerated vaccine development.},

title = {Improving the realism of deterministic multi-strain models: implications for modelling influenza A},
abstract = {Understanding the interaction between epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics for antigenically variable pathogens remains a challenge, particularly if analytical insight is wanted. In particular, while a variety of relatively complex simulation models have reproduced the evolutionary dynamics of influenza, simpler models have given less satisfying descriptions of the patterns seen in data. Here, we develop a set of relatively simple deterministic models of the transmission dynamics of multi-strain pathogens which give increased biological realism compared with past work. We allow the intensity of cross-immunity generated against one strain given exposure to a different strain to depend on the extent of genetic difference between the strains. We show that the dynamics of this model are determined by the interplay of parameters defining the cross-immune response function and can include fully symmetric equilibria, self-organized strain structures, regular periodic and chaotic regimes. We then extend the model by incorporating transient strain-transcending immunity that acts as a density-dependent mechanism to lower overall infection prevalence and thus pathogen diversity. We conclude that while some aspects of the evolution of influenza can be captured by deterministic models, overall, the description obtainable using a purely deterministic framework is unsatisfactory, implying that stochasticity of strain generation (via mutation) and extinction needs to be captured to appropriately capture influenza dynamics.},

title = {Public perceptions, anxiety, and behaviour change in relation to the swine flu outbreak: cross sectional telephone survey},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess whether perceptions of the swine flu outbreak predicted changes in behaviour among members of the public in England, Scotland, and Wales. DESIGN: Cross sectional telephone survey using random digit dialling. SETTING: Interviews by telephone between 8 and 12 May. PARTICIPANTS: 997 adults aged 18 or more who had heard of swine flu and spoke English. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recommended change in behaviour (increases in handwashing and surface cleaning or plans made with a "flu friend") and avoidance behaviours (engaged in one or more of six behaviours such as avoiding large crowds or public transport). RESULTS: 37.8% of participants (n=377) reported performing any recommended behaviour change "over the past four days . . . because of swine flu." 4.9% (n=49) had carried out any avoidance behaviour. Controlling for personal details and anxiety, recommended changes were associated with perceptions that swine flu is severe, that the risk of catching it is high risk, that the outbreak will continue for a long time, that the authorities can be trusted, that good information has been provided, that people can control their risk of catching swine flu, and that specific behaviours are effective in reducing the risk. Being uncertain about the outbreak and believing that the outbreak had been exaggerated were associated with a lower likelihood of change. The strongest predictor of behaviour change was ethnicity, with participants from ethnic minority groups being more likely to make recommended changes (odds ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 5.3) and carry out avoidance behaviours (4.1, 2.0 to 8.4). CONCLUSIONS: The results support efforts to inform the public about specific actions that can reduce the risks from swine flu and to communicate about the government's plans and resources. Tackling the perception that the outbreak has been "over-hyped" may be difficult but worthwhile. Additional research is required into differing reactions to the outbreak among ethnic groups.},

title = {Transmission dynamics of Schistosoma japonicum in the lakes and marshlands of China},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosoma japonicum is a major public health concern in China, with over one million people infected and another 40 million living in areas at risk of infection. Unlike the disease caused by S. mansoni and S. haematobium, schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonosis, involving a number of different mammalian species as reservoir hosts. As a result of a number of published reports from China, it has long been considered that bovines, particularly water buffaloes, play a major role in human S. japonicum transmission there, and a drug-based intervention study (1998-2003) around the Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province provided proof of concept that water buffaloes are, indeed, major reservoirs of human infection in this setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study we incorporated recently obtained epidemiological information to model the steady-state S. japonicum transmission as well as the impact of the removal of S. japonicum transmission attributable to water buffaloes on human infection rates across six different endemic scenarios within three villages in the Dongting (Hunan) and Poyang (Jiangxi) lakes of southern China. Similar results were obtained for all scenarios. Steady-state S. japonicum infection rates remained constant and human prevalence and incidence were predicted to fall considerably over time. The model showed that the contribution of S. japonicum water buffalo transmission to human infection ranged from 39.1% to 99.1% and predicted that the removal of water buffalo transmission would reduce parasite reproductive rates below 1. This indicates that without the contribution of water buffaloes, S. japonicum transmission is interrupted and unsustainable. These scenarios are generalizable to other endemic villages in the lake and marshland areas of China where a similar cycle of snail infection and infection/reinfection of humans and bovines occurs. CONCLUSIONS: Along with previous epidemiological data, our findings strongly support water buffaloes as an important component of the transmission cycle that affects humans in the lake and marshlands region of China, a feature which appears to differ from the situation prevalent in the Philippines where their contribution is less pronounced. Our conclusions underscore the rationale for removal, replacement or treatment of water buffaloes, and for the development and deployment of a transmission blocking buffalo vaccine against S. japonicum for this setting to achieve the goal of transmission control. The Chinese Government has recently commenced a new integrated national strategy to improve on existing approaches to control schistosomiasis in the lake and marshlands region by reducing bovines and humans as a source of S. japonicum infection to Oncomelania snails.},

abstract = {We describe the design and report baseline results of a cluster-randomized intervention to determine the importance of bovines for Schistosoma japonicum transmission in southern China. The study involves four matched village pairs in Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces, with a village within each pair randomly selected as intervention (human and bovine praziquantel treatment) or control (human praziquantel treatment only). Total study population prevalences at baseline were 12.4% (n = 5,390) and 15.2% (n = 1,573) for humans and bovines, respectively; village prevalences were similar within pairs. Bovine contamination index calculations showed that bovines less than 24 months of age were responsible for 74% of daily bovine environmental contamination with S. japonicum eggs. The village characteristics and baseline results underpin a rigorous study, which has major implications for deployment of a transmission-blocking bovine vaccine against S. japonicum. The combination of such a vaccine with other control strategies could potentially eliminate S. japonicum from southern China.},

title = {Appropriate models for the management of infectious diseases},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mathematical models have become invaluable management tools for epidemiologists, both shedding light on the mechanisms underlying observed dynamics as well as making quantitative predictions on the effectiveness of different control measures. Here, we explain how substantial biases are introduced by two important, yet largely ignored, assumptions at the core of the vast majority of such models. METHODS AND FINDINGS: First, we use analytical methods to show that (i) ignoring the latent period or (ii) making the common assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods (when including the latent period) always results in underestimating the basic reproductive ratio of an infection from outbreak data. We then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an influenza outbreak. Finally, we document how such unrealistic a priori assumptions concerning model structure give rise to systematically overoptimistic predictions on the outcome of potential management options. CONCLUSION: This work aims to highlight that, when developing models for public health use, we need to pay careful attention to the intrinsic assumptions embedded within classical frameworks.},

title = {On estimation of vaccine efficacy using validation samples with selection bias},
abstract = {Using validation sets for outcomes can greatly improve the estimation of vaccine efficacy (VE) in the field (Halloran and Longini, 2001; Halloran and others, 2003). Most statistical methods for using validation sets rely on the assumption that outcomes on those with no cultures are missing at random (MAR). However, often the validation sets will not be chosen at random. For example, confirmational cultures are often done on people with influenza-like illness as part of routine influenza surveillance. VE estimates based on such non-MAR validation sets could be biased. Here we propose frequentist and Bayesian approaches for estimating VE in the presence of validation bias. Our work builds on the ideas of Rotnitzky and others (1998, 2001), Scharfstein and others (1999, 2003), and Robins and others (2000). Our methods require expert opinion about the nature of the validation selection bias. In a re-analysis of an influenza vaccine study, we found, using the beliefs of a flu expert, that within any plausible range of selection bias the VE estimate based on the validation sets is much higher than the point estimate using just the non-specific case definition. Our approach is generally applicable to studies with missing binary outcomes with categorical covariates.},

abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is caused by an RNA virus of the genus Aphthovirus; 7 immunologically distinct serotypes of the virus have been identified. Susceptible species are mainly domestic and wild even-toed ungulates, such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, bison, and deer. All body fluids of infected animals can contain the virus and are considered infective. The primary mode of transmission is animal-to-animal transmission through inhalation or ingestion of aerosols containing the virus. The virus can also be spread mechanically by contaminated organic debris and fomites and can survive for 48 hours on human oral and nasal mucosa and be spread to uninfected animals in this manner. There is a rapid progression of clinical signs after an animal becomes infected, and the virus spreads rapidly throughout a herd. Clinical signs include excessive salivation; fever; vesicles and erosions of the oral and nasal mucosa, coronary band, interdigital area, and teats; lameness; sloughing of claws; reluctance to move; anorexia; mastitis; decreased milk production; and abortion or weak newborns. In mature animals, FMD has high morbidity and low mortality rates. Infected animals can become inapparent carriers of the virus.},

title = {Population genetics of multi-host parasites--the case for molecular epidemiological studies of Schistosoma japonicum using larval stages from naturally infected hosts},
abstract = {Population genetics of multi-host pathogens offers great potential for the understanding of their complex epidemiology but care must be taken to ensure that the sampling procedure does not bias estimates of population indices. The transfer of material to laboratory passage, in particular, runs the risk of bottlenecking and imposing non-random host-induced selection pressures according to the hosts used in passage. We present a novel technique allowing single-locus microsatellite genotyping of the naturally sampled larval stages, enabling unbiased population genetic studies of the multi-host zoonotic parasite Schistosoma japonicum. The utility of these larval genotyping methods for molecular epidemiological studies are illustrated in results from 3 separate data sets. In the first data set, potential loss of alleles based on the definitive host species used for laboratory maintenance was identified by comparing adult worm populations derived from mice and rabbits infected with cercarial populations originating from the same set of snails. In the second data set, bottlenecking was demonstrated by the loss of alleles in adult worms derived within a single generation of laboratory maintenance compared to their parent field-collected cercarial samples. In the final data set, comparison of miracidia and adult worms recovered from naturally infected animals demonstrated that larval analyses can provide stage-specific epidemiological information and that population genetics of schistosomes can be well described by analysis of larval stages. Our results thus advocate the use of natural life-cycle stages to obtain an accurate and ethical representation of the population genetic structure of S. japonicum and other multi-host pathogens.},

Sustained human-to-human transmission is necessary to trigger influenza pandemic and estimating the reproduction ratio (average number of secondary cases per primary case) is necessary for forecasting the spread of infection. We use two methods to estimate the reproduction ratio from the epidemic curve in Mexico using three plausible generation intervals (the time between primary and secondary case infection). As expected, the reproduction ratio estimates were highly sensitive to assumptions regarding the generation interval, which remains to be estimated for the current epidemic. Here, we suggest that the reproduction ratio was less than 2.2 - 3.1 in Mexico, depending on the generation interval. Monitoring and updating the reproduction ratio estimate as the epidemic spreads outside Mexico into different settings should remain a priority for assessing the situation and helping to plan public health interventions.},

Epidemiological analyses have been vital in delivering scientific advice to government on effective control measures. Using disease, culling and census data on all livestock farms in Great Britain, we analysed the risk factors determining the spatiotemporal evolution of the epidemic and of the impact of control policies on FMD incidence. Here we show that the species mix, animal numbers and the number of distinct land parcels in a farm are central to explaining regional variation in transmission intensity. We use the parameter estimates thus obtained in a dynamical model of disease spread to show that extended culling programmes were essential for controlling the epidemic to the extent achieved, but demonstrate that the epidemic could have been substantially reduced in scale had the most efficient control measures been rigorously applied earlier.},

title = {The effect of superspreading on epidemic outbreak size distributions},
abstract = {Recently, evidence has been presented to suggest that there are significant heterogeneities in the transmission of communicable diseases. Here, a stochastic simulation model of an epidemic process that allows for these heterogeneities is used to demonstrate the potentially considerable effect that heterogeneity of transmission will have on epidemic outbreak size distributions. Our simulation results agree well with approximations gained from the theory of branching processes. Outbreak size distributions have previously been used to infer basic epidemiological parameters. We show that if superspreading does occur then such distributions must be interpreted with care. The simulation results are discussed in relation to measles epidemics in isolated populations and in predominantly urban scenarios. The effect of three different disease control policies on outbreak size distributions are shown for varying levels of heterogeneity and disease control effort.},

title = {A comparison of predictions made by three simulation models of foot-and-mouth disease},
abstract = {AIMS: To describe results of a relative validation exercise using the three simulation models of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in use by the quadrilateral countries (QUADS; Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and United States of America; USA). METHODS: A hypothetical population of farms was constructed and, following the introduction of an FMD-like disease into a single farm, spread of disease was simulated using each of the three FMD simulation models used by the QUADS countries. A series of 11 scenarios was developed to systematically evaluate the key processes of disease transmission and control used by each of the three models. The predicted number of infected units and the size of predicted outbreak areas for each scenario and each model were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Agreement among the three models in terms of geographical areas predicted to become infected were quantified using Fleiss' Kappa statistic. RESULTS: Although there were statistically significant differences in model outputs in terms of the numbers of units predicted to become infected, the temporal onset of infection throughout the simulation period, and the spatial distribution of infected units, these differences were generally small and would have resulted in the same (or similar) management decisions being adopted in each case. CONCLUSIONS: Agreement among the three models in terms of the numbers of premises predicted to become infected, the temporal onset of infection throughout the simulation period, and the spatial distribution of infected premises provides evidence that each of the model developers are consistent in their approach to simulating the spread of disease throughout a population of susceptible individuals. This consistency implies that the assumptions taken by each development team are appropriate, which in turn serves to increase end-user confidence in model predictions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Relative validation is one of a number of steps that can be undertaken to increase end-user confidence in predictions made by infectious disease models.},

title = {Protection against influenza after annually repeated vaccination: a meta-analysis of serologic and field studies},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: According to common recommendations, influenza vaccination should be performed annually. It has been suggested that vaccination in previous years reduces vaccine efficacy in the long term. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the protection of influenza vaccine decreases when vaccination is repeated annually. METHODS: Articles published between 1966 and 1997 were selected from MEDLINE. The end point for field studies was the influenza-related morbidity or mortality during influenza outbreaks (resulting in field protection rates). The end point for serologic studies was exceeding a protective postvaccination hemagglutination-inhibition titer (serologic protection rates). Protection rate differences between groups with single and multiple vaccinations were subjected to meta-analysis. RESULTS: Seven field studies (including 13 trials) supported the hypothesis that protection in multiple-vaccination groups is at least as good as that in single-vaccination groups. Ten trials with 5117 observations could be subjected to meta-analysis. The pooled protection-rate difference was close to 0 (1.1%; 95% confidence interval, -0.2% to 2.4%), thus detecting no difference between single or multiple vaccination. Twelve serologic studies (including 53 trials) showed heterogeneous results: 9 trials were significantly in favor of single vaccination, and 7 were in favor of multiple vaccination, but in most cases, there was no significant difference between the 2 vaccination groups. The pooled serologic protection-rate difference from 52 trials (12341 observations) was again close to 0 (1.7%; 95% confidence interval, -1.3% to 4.8%). CONCLUSIONS: We did not detect any evidence for a decreasing protection with annually repeated influenza vaccination. Annual vaccination should not be discouraged in populations at risk.},

title = {The evaluation of control measures against Schistosoma mekongi in Cambodia by a mathematical model},
abstract = {We constructed a mathematical model for the transmission of Schistosoma mekongi in Cambodia. The simulation of the model will be instrumental in planning schistosomiasis control measures. The model includes two definitive hosts, humans and dogs, as animal reservoirs. Dogs are recognized to play an important role in schistosomiasis transmission in Cambodia. For the purpose of dealing with age-specific prevalence and intensity of infection, the human population was classified into eight age categories in the model. To describe the seasonal fluctuation of the intermediate host population of S. mekongi, the "Post-Spate Survival" hypothesis was adopted for the population dynamics of Neotricula aperta present in the Mekong River. We carried out simulations to evaluate the effect of universal treatment (UT) and targeted mass treatment (TT) with praziquantel on the reduction in prevalence of S. mekongi. The simulations indicated that biyearly UT for 8 years or yearly TT for 5 years after three courses of yearly UT could reduce the prevalence to below 5% when a UT or TT coverage of 85% of inhabitants was achieved. The simulation suggested that the suppression of S. mekongi in Cambodia would be possible by UT or TT with a high coverage rate.},

abstract = {Pregnant women are at increased risk for complications from influenza. Since 2004, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Committee on Obstetric Practice have recommended that all pregnant women be vaccinated with the trivalent inactivated vaccine during any trimester of pregnancy. To assess the percentage of women who were vaccinated during pregnancy among women with recent live births, CDC analyzed data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System (PRAMS) from Georgia and Rhode Island, the two states that collected this information on the PRAMS survey. This report summarizes the results, which showed that in Georgia, the prevalence of influenza vaccination during the woman's most recent pregnancy increased from 10.4% in 2004 to 15.5% in 2006. In Rhode Island, vaccination prevalence increased from 21.9% in 2004 to 33.4% in 2007. During 2006 in Georgia, the most common reasons for not receiving vaccination were, "I don't normally get the flu vaccination" (69.4%), and "my physician did not mention anything about a flu vaccine during my pregnancy" (44.5%). Increased efforts are needed to assess vaccine coverage during pregnancy and to educate providers and pregnant women about ACIP and ACOG recommendations on providing intramuscular, inactivated influenza vaccine during any trimester of pregnancy.},

title = {Symptom pathogenesis during acute influenza: interleukin-6 and other cytokine responses},
abstract = {In experimental human influenza infection initiated by nasal inoculation, the magnitude of viral replication, fever, and symptoms correlate with nasopharyngeal lavage fluid levels of various cytokines. Our aim was to assess these relationships in patients with naturally occurring acute influenza. Patients with culture-positive influenza illness of less than 36 hr of duration were studied. Nasopharyngeal washing were collected at enrollment and on Day 2, 4, 6 and 8 for quantitative virus isolation and IL-6, TNF-alpha, INF-alpha, INF-gamma and IL-10 determinations. Blood samples collected at entry and on Day 2 and 6 were processed to assess plasma cytokines and circulating influenza RNA. Patients received either oseltamivir or placebo for 5 days. We assessed the correlation between nasopharyngeal lavage fluid or blood levels of cytokines before treatment and viral titers, symptom severity and fever. Sixteen adult subjects (median age of 22 years) were studied. In this small group of patients no significant differences between placebo and oseltamivir patients were found in viral replication or measures of cytokines. Thus the data for all 16 subjects were pooled for analysis. At entry, influenza A viruses were cultured from nasopharyngeal washes at a median titer of 4.8 log(10)TCID(50)/ml of wash. Viral titers correlated positively with symptom score (P = 0.006) and temperature values (P < 0.001). Viral titers, fever and symptoms were highest at enrollment and fell in parallel during the subsequent days. RT-PCR assays failed to detect influenza RNA in the white blood cells from any patient. We observed a significant release, in both nasopharyngeal lavage fluid and in plasma, of IL-6, TNF-alpha, INF-alpha, INF-gamma and IL-10. At entry high IL-6 levels were detected in the nasopharyngeal lavage fluid (median 10.3 pg/ml) and plasma (median 5.1 pg/ml) of all patients. We found a positive correlation between plasma IL-6 levels and both symptom scores and temperature values (P < 0.05), as well as a positive correlation between nasopharyngeal lavage fluid levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha and temperature (P < 0.05). We did not find significant associations between symptoms, fever and levels of INF-alpha, INF-gamma or IL-10. The magnitude of early decrease in viral titers correlated with initial levels of INF-gamma in nasopharyngeal lavage fluid (P < 0.05). Significant production of IL-6, TNF-alpha, INF-alpha, INF-gamma and IL-10 occurs in response to community acquired influenza A illness. As in experimental influenza, symptoms and fever in natural acute influenza correlate with the release of IL-6.},

Here, we analyse historical vital statistics and quantify the age-specific mortality patterns associated with the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic in Japan, USA, and UK. All three countries showed highly elevated mortality risk in young adults relative to surrounding non-pandemic years. By contrast, the risk of death was low in the very young and very old. In Japan, the overall mortality impact was not limited to winter 1918-1919, and continued during winter 1919-1920. Mortality impact varied as much as threefold across the 47 Japanese prefectures, and differences in baseline mortality, population demographics, and density explained a small fraction of these variations. Our study highlights important geographical variations in timing and mortality impact of historical pandemics, in particular between the Eastern and Western hemispheres. In a future pandemic, vaccination in one region could save lives even months after the emergence of a pandemic virus in another region.},

title = {Mixed strain schistosome infections of snails and the evolution of parasite virulence},
abstract = {Mathematical models often propose that within-host competition between parasites can be a major factor in the evolution of increased parasite virulence. Kin selection predicts that as the coefficient of relatedness between infecting parasites decreases, the benefits of competition to individual genotypes increases. Thus where parasites can adjust their behaviour in response to current conditions, higher virulence is predicted in multiple genotype infections. There is limited experimental data, however, regarding the effects of mixed strain infections on host and parasite fitness. We investigated, for a snail-schistosome system, whether a conditional increase in replication rates occurred in mixed genotype infections and resulted in increased virulence. Four groups of Biomphalaria glabrata snails were exposed to 1 or 2 laboratory strains of Schistosoma mansoni. Mixed genotype infections were observed to be more virulent than single genotype infections, in terms of reductions in host reproductive success and survival. Parasite reproductive rate was also increased in mixed strain groups. Reduced host reproductive success was suggested to be directly due to the genetic heterogeneity of the parasitic infections resulting in increased host defence costs. Reduced host survival was consistent with an adaptive conditional parasite response.},

abstract = {During May 2009, a few weeks after 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection was first detected in the United States, outbreaks among students from two schools were detected in Greenwich, Connecticut. Staff members from Greenwich Hospital and the Connecticut Department of Public Health collected data on symptoms for 63 patients and submitted nasopharyngeal washings for testing using a rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) for influenza A and B and real-time reverse transcription--polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay, thereby affording an opportunity to assess the field performance of the RIDT. A total of 49 patients had infections with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) confirmed by rRT-PCR. This report summarizes the findings from this performance assessment, which indicated that, compared with rRT-PCR, the sensitivity of the RIDT for detecting infection in patients with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was 47%, and the specificity was 86%. Sensitivity and specificity did not vary substantially by the presence or absence of CDC-defined influenza-like illness (ILI) or by time from symptom onset to specimen acquisition. In this group of patients, although positive RIDT results performed well in predicting confirmed infection with pandemic H1N1 virus (positive predictive value: 92%), negative tests did not accurately predict the absence of infection (negative predictive value: 32%). These results affirm recent CDC recommendations against using negative RIDT results for management of patients with possible 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection.},

Should this virus, or another zoonotic influenza virus, gain the ability of sustained human-to-human transmission, an influenza pandemic could result. We used statistical methods to test whether observed clusters of HPAI (H5N1) illnesses in families in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, and eastern Turkey were due to human-to-human transmission. Given that human-to-human transmission occurs, we estimate the infection secondary attack rates (SARs) and the local basic reproductive number, R0. We find statistical evidence of human-to-human transmission (p = 0.009) in Sumatra but not in Turkey (p = 0.114). For Sumatra, the estimated household SAR was 29% (95% confidence interval [CI] 15%-51%). The estimated lower limit on the local R0 was 1.14 (95% CI 0.61-2.14). Effective HPAI (H5N1) surveillance, containment response, and field evaluation are essential to monitor and contain potential pandemic strains.},

Late spring "herald" waves of infection occurred in 1977 (A/H3N2), 1978 (A/H1N1) and 1979 (type B), the latter presaging an epidemic in 1979-1980. Out-of-season infections, recognized by serology only, included type B and A/H3N2 viruses in each summer and A/H1N1 virus in 1978. In epidemic seasons, infection rates were highest in children aged 5-9 years (A/H3N2) or in teenagers (A/H1N1 and type B). A/H1N1 virus caused the sharpest epidemic, with 31% of the population (but only 2% of adults) infected and 72% of households invaded in 1978-1979. These compare with infection rates of 17-24% overall and 6-13% of adults and the invasion of 38-53% of households observed in the type B and two A/H3N2 epidemics. Extended observation (largely serologic) of a cohort of 1965-1969 Virus Watch families for up to 14 years (including one three-year gap) indicated overall infection rates of 13.7 and 16.4 per 100 person-years with types B and A/H3N2 viruses, respectively, and rates of first and second reinfections of about 3 and 1 per 100 person-years, respectively, with each virus. Close surveillance in 1975-1979 revealed second family episodes of infection with each prevalent virus, 37 with A/H3N2, 15 with type B and 13 with A/H1N1 virus. Risk of infection in these episodes was related more to current hemagglutination-inhibiting titers than to experience (infected or not) in the initial episodes, with 67-100% reinfection when titers were low. Among younger (less than 20 years old) members, related illness was as frequent with reinfection as with initial infection.},

These updated guidelines replace the previous immunization guidelines published in 2002. These guidelines are prepared for health care professionals who care for either immunocompetent or immunocompromised people of all ages. Since 2002, the capacity to prevent more infectious diseases has increased markedly for several reasons: new vaccines have been licensed (human papillomavirus vaccine; live, attenuated influenza vaccine; meningococcal conjugate vaccine; rotavirus vaccine; tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis [Tdap] vaccine; and zoster vaccine), new combination vaccines have become available (measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine; tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis and inactivated polio vaccine; and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis and inactivated polio/Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine), hepatitis A vaccines are now recommended universally for young children, influenza vaccines are recommended annually for all children aged 6 months through 18 years and for adults aged 50 years, and a second dose of varicella vaccine has been added to the routine childhood and adolescent immunization schedule. Many of these changes have resulted in expansion of the adolescent and adult immunization schedules. In addition, increased emphasis has been placed on removing barriers to immunization, eliminating racial/ethnic disparities, addressing vaccine safety issues, financing recommended vaccines, and immunizing specific groups, including health care providers, immunocompromised people, pregnant women, international travelers, and internationally adopted children. This document includes 46 standards that, if followed, should lead to optimal disease prevention through vaccination in multiple population groups while maintaining high levels of safety.},

To identify the possible source of the infection, the human isolate and other H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from Hong Kong poultry markets from January to October 2003 were genetically and antigenically characterized. The findings of this study show that the human H9N2 influenza virus, A/Hong Kong/2108/03, is of purely avian origin and is closely related to some viruses circulating in poultry in the markets of Hong Kong. The continued presence of H9N2 influenza viruses in poultry markets in southern China increases the likelihood of avian-to-human interspecies transmission.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the disease and economic burden of hospitalization of influenza among patients with cancer in Taiwan using a complete medical database for Taiwanese patient records from 1999 to 2005. METHODS: The diagnosis of influenza-related infections was extracted as any ICD-9, the principal diagnosis code for influenza, bronchopneumonia, or pneumonia caused by a non-specific organism and the diagnosis code for cancer. From these two diagnosis codes, we estimated excess cases during the influenza season for each year and stratum. RESULTS: During the 7-year-study period, a total of 69,411 hospitalizations were identified for their principal diagnosis of influenza. The average lengths of hospital stay (LOS) and artificial ventilation procedures were 10.2, 8.9, 13.2, 5.0 days, and 0.7, 1.5, 3.5, 0.1% among patients with a cancer diagnosis, a chronic disease diagnosis, cancer combined with a chronic disease diagnosis, and the general population, respectively. Patients with cancer had higher rates of hospitalization with influenza-related infection than those without cancer diagnosis (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Among hospitalizations of influenza, those with a diagnosis of cancer and of chronic disease were reported to have a longer LOS and higher frequency of artificial ventilation procedures compared to those without a secondary diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease. Immunization among patients with cancer and their contacts is recommended to reduce the disease and economic burden in Taiwan.},

abstract = {The neuraminidase (NA) of influenza virus is the target of anti-flu drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. Clinical practices showed that oseltamivir was effective to treat the 2009-H1N1 influenza but failed to the 2006-H5N1 avian influenza. To perform an in-depth analysis on such a drug-resistance problem, the 2009-H1N1-NA structure was developed. To compare it with the crystal 2006-H5N1-NA structure as well as the 1918 influenza virus H1N1-NA structure, the multiple sequential and structural alignments were performed. It has been revealed that the hydrophobic residue Try347 in H5N1-NA does not match with the hydrophilic carboxyl group of oseltamivir as in the case of H1N1-NA. This may be the reason why H5N1 avian influenza virus is drug-resistant to oseltamivir. The finding provides useful insights for how to modify the existing drugs, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, making them not only become more effective against H1N1 virus but also effective against H5N1 virus.},

OBJECTIVES: Determine analytical sensitivity of selected commercially available rapid influenza antigen detection tests in detecting S-OIV H1N1. STUDY DESIGN: Serial dilutions of two S-OIV isolates, one seasonal influenza A (H1N1) isolate and a nasopharyngeal aspirate from a patient with S-OIV disease were tested in five commercially available influenza antigen detection tests and by virus isolation in cell culture. Viral M gene copy number was determined by quantitative PCR methods. RESULTS: The analytical sensitivity of the five influenza antigen detection tests for S-OIV (tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID(50)) log(10)3.3-4.7 was comparable with that of seasonal influenza (TCID(50) log(10)4.0-4.5).

abstract = {PB1-F2 is a small influenza A virus (IAV) protein encoded by an alternative (+1) reading frame of the PB1 gene. While dispensable for IAV replication in cultured cells, PB1-F2 has been implicated in IAV pathogenicity. To better understand PB1-F2 expression in vivo and its immunogenicity, we analyzed anti-PB1-F2 antibodies (Abs) in sera of mice infected intranasally (i.n.) with A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus and human acute and convalescent sera collected from the influenza H3N2 winter 2003-2004 epidemic. We explored a number of methods for detecting anti-PB1-F2 Abs, finding that PB1-F2-specific Abs could clearly be detected via immunoprecipitation or immunofluorescence assays using both immune mouse and human convalescent sera. Importantly, paired human sera exhibited similar increases in HI titers and PB1-F2-specific Abs. This study indicates that PB1-F2 is expressed in sufficient quantities in mice and humans infected with IAV to elicit an Ab response, supporting the biological relevance of this intriguing accessory protein.},

In the model, community-acquired infection serves as a source of initial infection within households as well as of possible further cases. In addition, infected household members can infect others in the household. Maximum likelihood procedures for the model parameters are given. The model is fitted to symptom data on influenza and the common cold. Influenza seems to spread more easily in the community than within the household, while the opposite may be the case for the common cold. The model, which does not require specification of the time of onset of infection for individuals, can be fitted to serological data; this would provide a more accurate measure of household infection than the symptom data used.},

Large intervillage differences in egg counts exist in this region due to differences in transmission potential related to environmental differences in snail density and agricultural practices. After accounting for these intervillage differences, there was no kinship or household effect on egg excretion. This reinforces earlier findings that suggest environmental factors dominate risk in this region.},

title = {Response after One Dose of a Monovalent Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Vaccine -- Preliminary Report},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A novel influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus is responsible for the first influenza pandemic in 41 years. A safe and effective vaccine is urgently needed. A randomized, observer-blind, parallel-group trial evaluating two doses of an inactivated, split-virus 2009 H1N1 vaccine in healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years is ongoing at a single site in Australia. METHODS: This preliminary report evaluates the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine 21 days after the first of two scheduled doses. A total of 240 subjects, equally divided into two age groups (<50 years and >/=50 years), were enrolled and underwent randomization to receive either 15 mug or 30 mug of hemagglutinin antigen by intramuscular injection. We measured antibody titers using hemagglutination-inhibition and microneutralization assays at baseline and 21 days after vaccination. The coprimary immunogenicity end points were the proportion of subjects with antibody titers of 1:40 or more on hemagglutination-inhibition assay, the proportion of subjects with either seroconversion or a significant increase in antibody titer, and the factor increase in the geometric mean titer. RESULTS: By day 21 after vaccination, antibody titers of 1:40 or more were observed in 116 of 120 subjects (96.7%) who received the 15-mug dose and in 112 of 120 subjects (93.3%) who received the 30-mug dose. No deaths, serious adverse events, or adverse events of special interest were reported. Local discomfort (e.g., injection-site tenderness or pain) was reported by 46.3% of subjects, and systemic symptoms (e.g., headache) by 45.0% of subjects. Nearly all events were mild to moderate in intensity. CONCLUSIONS: A single 15-mug dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine was immunogenic in adults, with mild-to-moderate vaccine-associated reactions.

abstract = {Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with approximately 8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.},

title = {Comparative efficacy of inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccines},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The efficacy of influenza vaccines may vary from year to year, depending on a variety of factors, and may differ for inactivated and live attenuated vaccines. METHODS: We carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of licensed inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccines in healthy adults during the 2007-2008 influenza season and estimated the absolute and relative efficacies of the two vaccines. RESULTS: A total of 1952 subjects were enrolled and received study vaccines in the fall of 2007. Influenza activity occurred from January through April 2008, with the circulation of influenza types A (H3N2) (about 90%) and B (about 9%). Absolute efficacy against both types of influenza, as measured by isolating the virus in culture, identifying it on real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assay, or both, was 68% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46 to 81) for the inactivated vaccine and 36% (95% CI, 0 to 59) for the live attenuated vaccine. In terms of relative efficacy, there was a 50% (95% CI, 20 to 69) reduction in laboratory-confirmed influenza among subjects who received inactivated vaccine as compared with those given live attenuated vaccine. The absolute efficacy against the influenza A virus was 72% (95% CI, 49 to 84) for the inactivated vaccine and 29% (95% CI, -14 to 55) for the live attenuated vaccine, with a relative efficacy of 60% (95% CI, 33 to 77) for the inactivated vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: In the 2007-2008 season, the inactivated vaccine was efficacious in preventing laboratory-confirmed symptomatic influenza A (predominately H3N2) in healthy adults. The live attenuated vaccine also prevented influenza illnesses but was less efficacious. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00538512.)},

title = {Performance of virus isolation and Directigen Flu A to detect influenza A virus in experimental human infection},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few data exist to assess the sensitivity of different specimen types for viral detection during the course of influenza virus infection. OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the relationships between quantitative influenza A virus replication and antigen detectability by the enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) Directigen Flu A in different type of samples during experimental human infection. STUDY DESIGN: Fourteen volunteers were inoculated with influenza A virus A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1). Four specimens types were collected in sequence for quantitative isolation in cell culture and antigen testing from days 1 to 8 after inoculation. RESULTS: Seventy-one (63%) of nasopharyngeal wash specimens were culture positive, compared to 51 (46%) of throat gargles, 51 (46%) of nasal swabs, and 27 (24%) of throat swabs. All subjects shed virus in their nasopharyngeal wash at least one day and 86% of subjects had a positive nasopharyngeal wash culture on day 2 after inoculation. The mean viral titers were highest on day 2 post inoculation for all specimen types and averaged 3.6 log10 TCID50/ml for nasal washes, 1.2 log10 TCID50/ml for throat gargles, 1.8 log10 TCID50/ml for the nasopharyngeal swabs, and 0.6 log10 TCID50/ml for the throat swabs. Mean viral titers in the nasal washes were significantly different (P<0.05) compared to other specimen types. The peak of sensitivity of EIA (compared to culture) was the second day after inoculation. Nasopharyngeal and throat swab results were combined for this analysis and considered positive by culture if positive in either or both samples. Thus, on day 2 the number of EIA positive samples relative to the number culture positive was 9/12 (75%) for nasopharyngeal wash specimens, 2/9 (22%) for throat gargles, and 7/11 (64%) for the combined throat and nasal swabs specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Nasopharyngeal washes are the most sensitive sample type detecting influenza A virus in adults. For rapid diagnosis the Directigen Flu A is an alternative with a sensitivity compared to culture ranging between 64 and 78% if performed on nasopharyngeal specimens on day two or three after experimental infection in adults. However, if performed on other specimens or later in the course of infection the sensitivity is lower.},

title = {Time variations in the transmissibility of pandemic influenza in Prussia, Germany, from 1918-19},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Time variations in transmission potential have rarely been examined with regard to pandemic influenza. This paper reanalyzes the temporal distribution of pandemic influenza in Prussia, Germany, from 1918-19 using the daily numbers of deaths, which totaled 8911 from 29 September 1918 to 1 February 1919, and the distribution of the time delay from onset to death in order to estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, defined as the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case at a given time. RESULTS: A discrete-time branching process was applied to back-calculated incidence data, assuming three different serial intervals (i.e. 1, 3 and 5 days). The estimated reproduction numbers exhibited a clear association between the estimates and choice of serial interval; i.e. the longer the assumed serial interval, the higher the reproduction number. Moreover, the estimated reproduction numbers did not decline monotonically with time, indicating that the patterns of secondary transmission varied with time. These tendencies are consistent with the differences in estimates of the reproduction number of pandemic influenza in recent studies; high estimates probably originate from a long serial interval and a model assumption about transmission rate that takes no account of time variation and is applied to the entire epidemic curve. CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that in order to offer robust assessments it is critically important to clarify in detail the natural history of a disease (e.g. including the serial interval) as well as heterogeneous patterns of transmission. In addition, given that human contact behavior probably influences transmissibility, individual countermeasures (e.g. household quarantine and mask-wearing) need to be explored to construct effective non-pharmaceutical interventions.},

title = {Factors influencing the transmission of Schistosoma japonicum in the mountains of Sichuan Province of China},
abstract = {Twenty villages in the Anning River Valley of southwestern Sichuan China were surveyed for Schistosoma japonicum infections in humans and domestic animals. Also surveyed were human water contact patterns, snail populations, cercarial risk in irrigation systems, and agricultural land use. Few animals were infected, while village prevalence of infection in humans ranged from 3% to 68% and average village eggs per gram of stool ranged from 0 to 110. Except for occupation and education, individual characteristics were not strong determinants of infection intensity within a village. Differences in human infection intensity between these villages are strongly associated with crop type, with low-intensity villages principally growing rice, in contrast to villages devoting more land to vegetables and tobacco. Cercarial risk in village irrigation systems is associated with snail density and human infection intensity through the use of manure-based fertilizer. Some of the agricultural and environmental factors associated with infection risk can be quantified using remote sensing technology.},

title = {High prevalence of amantadine resistance among circulating European porcine influenza A viruses},
abstract = {Genetic analysis of the M2 sequence of European porcine influenza A viruses reveals a high prevalence of amantadine resistance due to the substitution of serine 31 by asparagine in all three circulating subtypes, H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2. The M segment of all resistant strains belongs to a single genetic lineage. Whereas the first amantadine-resistant porcine strain was isolated in 1989, isolation of the last amantadine-susceptible strain dates to 1987, suggesting a displacement of amantadine-susceptible viruses by resistant strains soon after emergence of the mutation. Analysis of natural selection by codon-based tests indicates negative selection of codons 30, 31 and 34 which confer amantadine resistance. The codons 2, 11-28 and 54 of porcine and human strains exhibit differences in the patterns of substitution rates, suggesting different selection modes. Transfer of amantadine resistance by exchange of the M segment and viability of recombinant A/WSN/33 viruses with avian-like M segments raises concerns about the emergence of natural human reassortants.},

title = {High genetic and antigenic similarity between a swine H3N2 influenza A virus and a prior human influenza vaccine virus: a possible immune pressure-driven cross-species transmission},
abstract = {In late April of 2009, a global outbreak of human influenza was reported. The causative agent is a highly unusual reassortant H1N1 influenza virus carrying genetic segments derived from swine, human and avian influenza viruses. In this study, we compared the HA, NA and other gene segments of a swine H3N2 influenza A virus, A/Swine/Guangdong/z5/2003, which was isolated from pigs in 2003 in Guangdong Province, China, to the predominant human and swine H3N2 viruses. We found that the similarity of gene segments of A/Swine/Guangdong/z5/2003 was closer to Moscow/99-like human H3N2 virus than Europe swine H3N2 viruses during 1999-2002. These results suggest that A/Swine/Guangdong/z5/2003 may be porcine in origin, possibly being driven by human immune pressure induced by either natural H3N2 virus infection or use of A/Moscow/10/99 (H3N2)-based human influenza vaccine. The results further confirm that swine may play a dual role as a "shelter" for hosting influenza virus from humans or birds and as a "mixing vessel" for generating reassortant influenza viruses, such as the one causing current influenza pandemic.},

Indonesia has had the largest number of human infections and fatalities caused by these viruses. To understand the enzootic conditions of the viruses in Indonesia, twenty-four H5N1 viruses isolated from poultry from 2003 to 2007 were phylogenetically characterized. Although previous studies exclusively classified the Indonesian viruses into clades 2.1.1-2.1.3, our phylogenetic analyses showed a new sublineage that did not belong to any of the present clades. In addition, novel reassortant viruses were identified that emerged between this new sublineage and other clades in 2005-2006 on Java Island. H5N1 viruses were introduced from Java Island to Sulawesi, Kalimantan, and Sumatra Island on multiple occasions from 2003-2007, causing the geographical expansion of these viruses in Indonesia. These findings identify Java Island as the epicenter of the Indonesian H5N1 virus expansion.},

abstract = {Individuals with chronic lung disease and their families were selected from the Tecumsch community along with similarly selected families as comparison groups and studied for 1-year periods. Occurence of acute respiratory illness was ascertained weekly by telephone and calculated as an annual rate. Persons with chronic bronchitis not only experienced more acute lower respiratory illness than healthy comparison subjects, but total illness rates were somewhat higher as well. Infection rates were determined from blood samples taken 3 times from each participant during the surveillance year. Antibody tests were performed for respiratory syncytial virus, para-influenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, influenza types A and B, coronavirus OC43, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. Differences in serologic infection rates among the subgroups of the population were similar to those seen in the clinical data, with more frequent infection among those with bronchitis than among the comparison subjects. This finding indicates that some degree of increased susceptibility to actual infection existed among those individuals with bronchitis. Influence of smoking on illness and infection rates was also examined. Infections were, in general, more frequent in smokers than in nonsmokers, but illness rates were reversed, suggesting that perception of disease differed in the 2 groups. Rates of illness and infection of other adults in the families of the index individuals with bronchitis were not influenced by the higher rates seen in the index individuals; however, it was of interest that children of persons with bronchitis did have somewhat higher rates of infection than children of comparison subjects.},

One hundred sixty-three (31%) samples were positive for influenza viruses of which 111 (68%) were influenza A, 52 (31%) influenza B using an immuno-capture ELISA. Forty isolates were selected at random from influenza A positive samples and grown in MDCK cell cultures. The supernatant of the cell cultures was used for RNA extraction followed by RT-PCR to detect the sub-types. Sub-typing revealed all samples as A/H1N1. The N1 gene segment of 30 A/H1N1 samples was sequenced in part, from the 201st to 365th residue, which included the critical region for oseltamivir resistance. Then resulting sequences were analyzed with oseltamivir sensitive and resistant strains obtained from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank by CLC Main Workbench Software. H275Y (H274Y according to N2 numbering) mutation, which is known to confer resistance to oseltamivir, was detected in 6 out of 30 (20%) H1N1 isolates from four cities (Istanbul, Bursa, Ankara, and Izmir). The D354G mutation was observed in all oseltamivir resistant H1N1 isolates but not in the oseltamivir sensitive isolates. Assay of neuraminidase activity revealed that these isolates were resistant to oseltamivir, but sensitive to zanamivir.},

More than 95% of the viruses isolated in Vietnam and Thailand contained resistance mutations, but resistant mutants were less commonly isolated in Indonesia (6.3% of isolates) and China (8.9% of isolates), where human infection was recently reported. The dual mutation motif Leu26Ile-Ser31Asn (leucine-->isoleucine at aa 26 and serine-->asparagine at aa 31) was found almost exclusively in all resistant isolates from Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia, suggesting the biological selection of these mutations.},

title = {Certainties and uncertainties facing emerging respiratory infectious diseases: lessons from SARS},
abstract = {Every emerging infectious disease is a challenge to the whole of mankind. There are uncertainties regarding whether there will be a pandemic, if it will be caused by the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus, when or where it will occur, how imminent or how severe it will be. No one can accurately predict if and when a given virus will become a pandemic virus. Pandemic prevention strategies must be based on preparing for the unexpected and being capable of reacting accordingly. There is growing evidence that infection control measures were helpful in containment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as avian influenza. Compliance of standard infection control measures, intensive promotion of hand and respiratory hygiene, vigilance and triage of patients with febrile illness, and specific infection control measures are key components to contain a highly contagious disease in hospital and to protect healthcare workers, patients and visitors. The importance of standard precautions for any patient and cleaning and disinfection for the healthcare environment cannot be overemphasized. SARS illustrated dramatically the potential of air travel and globalization for the dissemination of an emerging infectious disease. To prevent the potential serious consequences of pandemic influenza, timely implementation of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions locally within the outbreak area is the key to minimizing global spread. Herein, we relate our perspective on useful lessons derived from a review of the SARS epidemic that may be useful to physicians, especially when looking ahead to the next epidemic.},

title = {Risk factors of influenza transmission in households},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza transmission in households is a subject of renewed interest, as the vaccination of children is currently under debate and antiviral treatments have been approved for prophylactic use. AIMS: To quantify the risk factors of influenza transmission in households. DESIGN OF STUDY: A prospective study conducted during the 1999 to 2000 winter season in France. SETTING: Nine hundred and forty-six households where a member, the index patient, had visited their general practitioner (GP) because of an influenza-like illness were enrolled in the study. Five hundred and ten of the index patients tested positive for influenza A (subtype H3N2). A standardised daily questionnaire allowed for identification of secondary cases of influenza among their household contacts, who were followed-up for 15 days. Of the 395 (77%) households that completed the questionnaire, we selected 279 where no additional cases had occurred on the day of the index patient's visit to the GP. METHODS: Secondary cases of influenza were those household contacts who had developed clinical influenza within 5 days of the disease onset in the index patient. Hazard ratios for individual clinical and demographic characteristics of the contact and their index patient were derived from a Cox regression model. RESULTS: Overall in the 279 households, 131 (24.1%) secondary cases occurred among the 543 household contacts. There was an increased risk of influenza transmission in preschool contacts (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 3.26) as compared with school-age and adult contacts. There was also an increased risk in contacts exposed to preschool index patients (HR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.09 to 3.42) and school-age index patients (HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.07 to 2.65), compared with those exposed to adult index cases. No other factor was associated with transmission of the disease. CONCLUSION: Our results support the major role of children in the dissemination of influenza in households. Vaccination of children or prophylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors would prevent, respectively, 32-38% and 21-41% of secondary cases caused by exposure to a sick child in the household.},

Also, discrete heterogeneity in the population can be modeled to incorporate variable susceptibility, variable infectivity, and/or mixing behaviors. The model is fitted to serologic data from two influenza epidemics in Tecumseh, Michigan, using maximum likelihood estimation procedures. The estimates show a clustering pattern by age groups.},

title = {Extending the environmental risk assessment for oseltamivir (Tamiflu) under pandemic use conditions to the coastal marine compartment},
abstract = {In case of an avian-influenza-derived human flu pandemic, an inordinately high use of medicines over several weeks is predicted, in particular for the recommended influenza antiviral oseltamivir (Tamiflu). While the risk of oseltamivir to sewage works and freshwater bodies has already been assessed, the fact that a large percentage of the human population worldwide lives relatively close to the sea raises concern for its environmental compatibility in coastal marine waters. The potential risk of high oseltamivir use to the marine compartment is assessed in this publication, based on the 2003 European Community Technical Guidance Document (TGD) for risk assessment. Subchronic embryo-larval ecotoxicity tests with three marine invertebrates (Pomatoceros triqueter, Annelida; Mytilus edulis, Mollusca; Paracentrotus lividus, Echinodermata) and chronic growth inhibition tests with two different groups of marine microalgae (Isochrysis galbana, Haptophyta; Skeletonema costatum, Heterokontophyta) were performed with the active substance oseltamivir carboxylic acid to derive a dependable marine predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC). This was compared to a predicted environmental concentration (PEC) for oseltamivir in coastal waters, based on the worst-case freshwater PEC. The PEC/PNEC risk characterisation ratio for the marine compartment is well below 1, which in the terminology of the TGD signifies no immediate concern. Further, while oseltamivir may be persistent (P), it is not bioaccumulative (B) nor highly ecotoxic (T) and therefore not a PBT substance. In conclusion, even a high pandemic use of oseltamivir would not lead to a significant risk for the marine compartment, in confirmation of the risk assessment for sewage works and freshwaters.},

abstract = {In the 2003-2004 influenza season, the predominant circulating influenza A (H3N2) virus in the United States was similar antigenically to A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2), a drift variant of A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2), the vaccine strain. That year, a field study of trivalent live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV-T) was conducted in Temple-Belton, Texas, as part of a larger community-based, non-randomized, open-label study in three communities that began in August 1998 [Gaglani MJ, Piedra PA, Herschler GB, Griffith ME, Kozinetz CA, Riggs MW, et al.

The analysis here concerns 6403 children in the Scott {\&} White Health Plan (SWHP) database living within zip codes of the Temple-Belton area, of whom 1706 received LAIV-T and 548 received trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) in 2003, 983 had been previously vaccinated in 1998-2001, but not in 2002-2003 or 2003, and 3166 had never been vaccinated. The main outcome measure was medically-attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI). Surveillance culture results were incorporated into the analysis to estimate efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza illness. Vaccine effectiveness of LAIV-T against MAARI was 26% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11, 39). Vaccine efficacy of LAIV-T against culture-confirmed influenza illness including surveillance cultures of children in the SWHP database in the validation calculation was 56% (95% CI 24, 84). LAIV-T was cross-protective with a drift variant strain in 2003-2004, evidence that such vaccines could be important for preparing for a pandemic and for annual influenza.},

title = {The waiting time for inter-country spread of pandemic influenza},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The time delay between the start of an influenza pandemic and its subsequent initiation in other countries is highly relevant to preparedness planning. We quantify the distribution of this random time in terms of the separate components of this delay, and assess how the delay may be extended by non-pharmaceutical interventions. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The model constructed for this time delay accounts for: (i) epidemic growth in the source region, (ii) the delay until an infected individual from the source region seeks to travel to an at-risk country, (iii) the chance that infected travelers are detected by screening at exit and entry borders, (iv) the possibility of in-flight transmission, (v) the chance that an infected arrival might not initiate an epidemic, and (vi) the delay until infection in the at-risk country gathers momentum. Efforts that reduce the disease reproduction number in the source region below two and severe travel restrictions are most effective for delaying a local epidemic, and under favourable circumstances, could add several months to the delay. On the other hand, the model predicts that border screening for symptomatic infection, wearing a protective mask during travel, promoting early presentation of cases arising among arriving passengers and moderate reduction in travel volumes increase the delay only by a matter of days or weeks. Elevated in-flight transmission reduces the delay only minimally. CONCLUSIONS: The delay until an epidemic of pandemic strain influenza is imported into an at-risk country is largely determined by the course of the epidemic in the source region and the number of travelers attempting to enter the at-risk country, and is little affected by non-pharmaceutical interventions targeting these travelers. Short of preventing international travel altogether, eradicating a nascent pandemic in the source region appears to be the only reliable method of preventing country-to-country spread of a pandemic strain of influenza.},

title = {Influenza drift and epidemic size: the race between generating and escaping immunity},
abstract = {Influenza in humans is characterised by strongly annual dynamics and antigenic evolution leading to partial escape from prior host immunity. The variability of new epidemic strains depends on the amount of virus currently circulating. In this paper, the amount of antigenic variation produced each year is dependent on the epidemic size. Our model reduces to a one-dimensional map and a full mathematical analysis is presented. This simple system suggests some basic principles which may be more generally applicable. In particular, for diseases with antigenic drift, vaccination may be doubly beneficial. Not only does it protect the population through classical herd immunity, but the overall case reduction reduces the chance of new variants being produced; hence, subsequent epidemics may be milder as a result of this positive feedback. Also, a disease with a high innate rate of antigenic variation will always be able to invade a susceptible population, whereas a disease with less potential for variation may require several introduction events to become endemic.},

With proper choice of relative susceptibility by age, length of latency and infectivity periods, pathogenicity and withdrawal patterns, and the relative infectiousness of silent infections, the model becomes highly agent-specific. The model includes flexible immunization routines and variable vaccine response patterns. The model is applied to the 1957 Asian and 1968 Hong Kong pandemic strains of influenza A.

title = {Constructing the effect of alternative intervention strategies on  historic epidemics},
abstract = {Data from historical epidemics provide a vital and sometimes under-used  resource from which to devise strategies for future control of disease.  Previous methods for retrospective analysis of epidemics, in which  alternative interventions are compared, do not make full use of the  information; by using only partial information on the historical  trajectory, augmentation of control may lead to predictions of a  paradoxical increase in disease. Here we introduce a novel statistical  approach that takes full account of the available information in  constructing the effect of alternative intervention strategies in  historic epidemics. The key to the method lies in identifying a  suitable mapping between the historic and notional outbreaks, under  alternative control strategies. We do this by using the Sellke  construction as a latent process linking epidemics. We illustrate the  application of the method with two examples. First, using temporal data  for the common human cold, we show the improvement under the new method  in the precision of predictions for different control strategies.  Second, we show the generality of the method for retrospective analysis  of epidemics by applying it to a spatially extended arboreal epidemic  in which we demonstrate the relative effectiveness of host culling  strategies that differ in frequency and spatial extent. Some of the  inferential and philosophical issues that arise are discussed along  with the scope of potential application of the new method.},

Of 103 respondents (response rate 40%), 95 were estimated to have been offered oseltamivir for prophylaxis, of whom 85 (89%) actually took any. Less than half (48%) of primary schoolchildren completed a full course, compared to three-quarters (76%) of secondary schoolchildren. More than half (53%) of all schoolchildren taking prophylactic oseltamivir reported one or more side effects. Gastrointestinal symptoms were reported by 40% of children and 18% reported a mild neuropsychiatric side effect. The results confirmed anecdotal evidence of poor adherence, provided timely information with which to assist decision-making, and formed part of the body of growing evidence that contributed to policy changes to restrict widespread use of prophylaxis for school contacts of confirmed cases of influenza A(H1N1)v.},

Sch{\"u}nemann and colleagues described a new process used by the World Health Organization for rapidly developing clinical management guidelines in emergency situations. These situations include outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. The authors discussed how they developed such a "rapid advice" guideline for the pharmacological management of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection. The guideline recommends giving the antiviral drug oseltamivir at a dose of 75 mg twice daily for five days. In this Debate, Nicholas White argues that such dosing is inadequate, Robert Webster and Elena Govorkova say that combination antiviral therapy should be used, and Tim Uyeki reminds us that clinical care of patients with H5N1 entails much more than antiviral treatment. These issues may also apply to therapy of patients hospitalized with severe disease due to novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus infection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The efficacy of the intranasal, live-attenuated, trivalent cold-adapted influenza virus vaccine (CAIV-T) against influenza A(H3N2) and B infections in healthy persons is established, but its effectiveness against natural influenza A(H1N1) infection is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of CAIV-T in healthy children during the 2000-2001 influenza A(H1N1) and B epidemic. DESIGN: Community-based, nonrandomized, open-label trial from August 1998 through April 2001. SETTING: Intervention and comparison communities in central Texas. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy children, aged 1.5 to 18 years, from the intervention communities received a single dose of CAIV-T at least 1 time or more in 1998, 1999, and/or 2000. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of medically attended acute respiratory illnesses during the 2000-2001 influenza epidemic was compared in 3794 health plan CAIV-T recipients with age-eligible, health plan nonrecipients in the intervention communities for direct effectiveness (n = 9325), and with those in the 2 comparison communities for total effectiveness (n = 16,264). RESULTS: The 2281 CAIV-T recipients in 2000 had significant direct protection against medically attended acute respiratory illness of 18% to 20% during the biphasic influenza A(H1N1) and B epidemic, and 17% to 26% during influenza A(H1N1) predominance. The 931 recipients of CAIV-T in 1999 containing influenza A/Beijing/262/95(H1N1) and B/Beijing/184/93-like viruses had persistent heterovariant protection against the 2000-2001 influenza A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1) and B/Sichuan/379/99 variants. The 616 recipients of a single CAIV-T dose in 1999 only, including those younger than 5 years with no prior natural exposure to influenza A(H1N1) viruses, showed persistent protection. CONCLUSION: Healthy children who received CAIV-T in 2000 or 1999 were protected against new variants of influenza A(H1N1) and B in the 2000-2001 influenza epidemic.},

title = {Factors that make an infectious disease outbreak controllable},
abstract = {The aim of this study is to identify general properties of emerging infectious agents that determine the likely success of two simple public health measures in controlling outbreaks, namely (i) isolating symptomatic individuals and (ii) tracing and quarantining their contacts. Because these measures depend on the recognition of specific disease symptoms, we investigate the relative timing of infectiousness and the appearance of symptoms by using a mathematical model. We show that the success of these control measures is determined as much by the proportion of transmission occurring prior to the onset of overt clinical symptoms (or via asymptomatic infection) as the inherent transmissibility of the etiological agent (measured by the reproductive number R(0)). From published studies, we estimate these quantities for two moderately transmissible viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and HIV, and for two highly transmissible viruses, smallpox and pandemic influenza. We conclude that severe acute respiratory syndrome and smallpox are easier to control using these simple public health measures. Direct estimation of the proportion of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections is achievable by contact tracing and should be a priority during an outbreak of a novel infectious agent.},

title = {The effects of influenza vaccination of health care workers in nursing homes: insights from a mathematical model},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Annual influenza vaccination of institutional health care workers (HCWs) is advised in most Western countries, but adherence to this recommendation is generally low. Although protective effects of this intervention for nursing home patients have been demonstrated in some clinical trials, the exact relationship between increased vaccine uptake among HCWs and protection of patients remains unknown owing to variations between study designs, settings, intensity of influenza seasons, and failure to control all effect modifiers. Therefore, we use a mathematical model to estimate the effects of HCW vaccination in different scenarios and to identify a herd immunity threshold in a nursing home department. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We use a stochastic individual-based model with discrete time intervals to simulate influenza virus transmission in a 30-bed long-term care nursing home department. We simulate different levels of HCW vaccine uptake and study the effect on influenza virus attack rates among patients for different institutional and seasonal scenarios. Our model reveals a robust linear relationship between the number of HCWs vaccinated and the expected number of influenza virus infections among patients. In a realistic scenario, approximately 60% of influenza virus infections among patients can be prevented when the HCW vaccination rate increases from 0 to 1. A threshold for herd immunity is not detected. Due to stochastic variations, the differences in patient attack rates between departments are high and large outbreaks can occur for every level of HCW vaccine uptake. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of herd immunity in nursing homes implies that vaccination of every additional HCW protects an additional fraction of patients. Because of large stochastic variations, results of small-sized clinical trials on the effects of HCW vaccination should be interpreted with great care. Moreover, the large variations in attack rates should be taken into account when designing future studies.},

title = {A quantitative framework for a multi-group model of Schistosomiasis japonicum transmission dynamics and control in Sichuan, China},
abstract = {A quantitative framework is presented for the site-specific characterization of schistosomiasis transmission with the object of developing local control strategies. Central to the framework is a worm-burden model using ordinary differential equations of disease transmission in risk groups defined by residence and occupation. The model incorporates temperature- and precipitation-dependent seasonality of infectious stages, snail population dynamics, and seasonal patterns of human water contact specific to the local agricultural setting. The model's parameters are separated into two main subsets, those associated with the general biology of the parasite and its life cycle in the human and the snail and those associated with directly measurable features of disease status in the local population or relevant aspects of the local environment. In this regard, the model is structured and parameterized to take maximum advantage of data that can be collected in rural China by conventional methods. For example, it includes a statistical model for egg excretion to the environment by each risk group which is based on local population surveys of the prevalence and intensity of infection. The second element of the framework of analysis relates to the strategy for parameter estimation and calibration to local conditions. We propose a Bayesian approach in which parameter estimates are refined over time by methods employing extensive computer simulations. An early analysis of data collected between 1987 and 1989 in endemic villages near Xichang City in southwestern Sichuan provides encouragement that parametric uncertainty can be reduced to levels adequate to explore effective control strategies.},

title = {The global circulation of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses},
abstract = {Antigenic and genetic analysis of the hemagglutinin of approximately 13,000 human influenza A (H3N2) viruses from six continents during 2002-2007 revealed that there was continuous circulation in east and Southeast Asia (E-SE Asia) via a region-wide network of temporally overlapping epidemics and that epidemics in the temperate regions were seeded from this network each year. Seed strains generally first reached Oceania, North America, and Europe, and later South America. This evidence suggests that once A (H3N2) viruses leave E-SE Asia, they are unlikely to contribute to long-term viral evolution. If the trends observed during this period are an accurate representation of overall patterns of spread, then the antigenic characteristics of A (H3N2) viruses outside E-SE Asia may be forecast each year based on surveillance within E-SE Asia, with consequent improvements to vaccine strain selection.},

Although a number of different data sources have been used to provide estimates of the health impact of influenza in the US, estimates provided in this article are primarily based upon the experiences reported in community-based studies performed in Houston, Texas, and Tecumseh, Michigan. Estimates of the annual average are provided for the following: (1) infection rate; (2) number of influenza-associated respiratory illnesses; (3) number of ill days with influenza; (4) number of bed and activity restriction days due to influenza illness; (5) physician visits; (6) hospitalisations and days hospitalised; and (7) mortality. Large differences were found between estimates from Houston and Tecumseh, and possible explanations for these are provided. However, all estimates find that influenza is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the US.},

title = {A geographical spread of vaccine-resistance in avian influenza epidemics},
abstract = {Vaccination can be a useful tool for control of avian influenza outbreaks in poultry, but its use is reconsidered in most of the countries worldwide because of its negative effects on the disease control. One of the most important negative effects is the potential for emergence of vaccine-resistant viruses. Actually, in the vaccination program in China and Mexico, several vaccine-resistant strains were confirmed. Vaccine-resistant strains usually cause a loss of the protection effectiveness of vaccination. Therefore, a vaccination program that engenders the emergence of the resistant strain might promote the spread of the resistant strain and undermine the control of the infectious disease, even if the vaccination protects against the transmission of a vaccine-sensitive strain. We designed and analyzed a deterministic patch-structured model in heterogeneous areas (with or without vaccination) illustrating transmission of vaccine-sensitive and vaccine-resistant strains during a vaccination program. We found that the vaccination program can eradicate the vaccine-sensitive strain but lead to a prevalence of vaccine-resistant strain. Further, interestingly, the replacement of viral strain could occur in another area without vaccination through a migration of non-infectious individuals due to an illegal trade of poultry. It is also a novel result that only a complete eradication of both strains in vaccination area can achieve the complete eradication in another areas. Thus we can obtain deeper understanding of an effect of vaccination for better development of vaccination strategies to control avian influenza spread.},

title = {Facemasks and Hand Hygiene to Prevent Influenza Transmission in Households: A Randomized Trial},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few data are available about the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as hand hygiene and facemasks, for preventing influenza virus transmission. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether hand hygiene and use of facemasks prevents household transmission of influenza. DESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial. Randomization was computer generated; allocation was concealed from treating physicians and clinics and implemented by study nurses at the time of the initial household visit. Participants and personnel administering the interventions were not blinded to group assignment. SETTING: Households in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: 407 people presenting to outpatient clinics with influenza-like illness who were positive for influenza A or B virus by rapid testing (index patients) and 794 household members (contacts) in 259 households. INTERVENTION: Lifestyle education (control) (134 households), hand hygiene (136 households), or surgical facemasks plus hand hygiene (137 households) for all household members. MEASUREMENTS: Influenza virus infection in household contacts, as confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or diagnosed clinically after 7 days. RESULTS: Sixty (8%) household contacts in the 259 households had RT-PCR-confirmed influenza virus infection in the 7 days after intervention. Hand hygiene without or with facemasks seemed to reduce influenza transmission, but the differences in transmission compared with the control group were not statistically significant. In 154 households in which interventions were implemented within 36 hours of symptom onset in the index patient, transmission of RT-PCR-confirmed infection seemed to be reduced, an effect attributable to reductions in infection among participants using facemasks plus hand hygiene (adjusted odds ratio, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.13 to 0.87]). Adherence to interventions was variable. Limitation: The delay from index patient symptom onset to intervention and variable adherence may have mitigated intervention effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Hand hygiene and facemasks seemed to prevent household transmission of influenza virus when implemented within 36 hours of index patient symptom onset. These findings suggest that nonpharmaceutical interventions are important for mitigation of pandemic and interpandemic influenza. Primary Funding Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.},

title = {Triple-Reassortant Swine Influenza A (H1) in Humans in the United States, 2005-2009},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Triple-reassortant swine influenza A (H1) viruses - containing genes from avian, human, and swine influenza viruses - emerged and became enzootic among pig herds in North America during the late 1990s. METHODS: We report the clinical features of the first 11 sporadic cases of infection of humans with triple-reassortant swine influenza A (H1) viruses, occurring from December 2005 through February 2009, until just before the current epidemic of swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) among humans. These data were obtained from routine national influenza surveillance reports and from joint case investigations by public and animal health agencies. RESULTS: The median age of the 11 patients was 10 years (range, 16 months to 48 years), and 4 had underlying health conditions. Nine of the patients had had exposure to pigs, five through direct contact and four through visits to a location where pigs were present but without contact. In another patient, human-to-human transmission was suspected. The range of the incubation period, from the last known exposure to the onset of symptoms, was 3 to 9 days. Among the 10 patients with known clinical symptoms, symptoms included fever (in 90%), cough (in 100%), headache (in 60%), and diarrhea (in 30%). Complete blood counts were available for four patients, revealing leukopenia in two, lymphopenia in one, and thrombocytopenia in another. Four patients were hospitalized, two of whom underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Four patients received oseltamivir, and all 11 recovered from their illness. CONCLUSIONS: From December 2005 until just before the current human epidemic of swine-origin influenza viruses, there was sporadic infection with triple-reassortant swine influenza A (H1) viruses in persons with exposure to pigs in the United States. Although all the patients recovered, severe illness of the lower respiratory tract and unusual influenza signs such as diarrhea were observed in some patients, including those who had been previously healthy.

title = {Influenza vaccination among adults with asthma findings from the 2007 BRFSS survey},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Asthma prevalence among U.S. adults is estimated to be 6.7%. People with asthma are at increased risk of complications from influenza. Influenza vaccination of adults and children with asthma is recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The Healthy People 2010 Objectives call for annual influenza vaccination of at least 60% of adults aged 18-64 years with asthma and other conditions associated with an increased risk of complications from influenza. PURPOSE: To assess influenza vaccination coverage among adults with asthma in the United States. METHODS: Data from the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System restricted to individuals interviewed during February through August were analyzed in 2008 to estimate national and state prevalence of self-reported receipt of influenza vaccination among respondents aged 18-64 years with asthma. Logistic regression provided predictive marginal vaccination coverage for each covariate, adjusted for demographic and access to care characteristics. RESULTS: Among adults aged 18-64 years with asthma, influenza vaccination coverage was 39.9% (95% CI=38.3%, 41.5%) during the 2006-2007 season (coverage ranged from 26.9% [95% CI=19.8%, 35.3%] in California to 53.3% [95% CI=42.8%, 63.6%] in Tennessee). Influenza vaccination coverage was 33.9% (95% CI=31.9%, 35.9%) for adults aged 18-49 years with asthma compared to 54.7% (95% CI=52.4%, 57.0%) for adults aged 50-64 years with asthma. Among people aged 18-64 years, vaccination coverage was 28.8% among those without asthma. People with asthma who had an increased likelihood of vaccination were aged 50-64 years, female, non-Hispanic white, and had diabetes, activity limitations, health insurance, a regular healthcare provider, routine checkup in the previous year, and formerly smoked or never smoked. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination coverage continues to be below the national objective of 60% for people aged 18-64 years with asthma as a high-risk condition. Increased state and national efforts are needed to improve influenza vaccination levels among this population and particularly among those aged 18-49 years.},

abstract = {We used a simulation study to assess the impact of an incursion of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus on the livestock industries in an 8-county area of the Panhandle region of Texas, USA. The study was conducted in a high-density livestock area, with an estimated number of cattle on-feed of approximately 1.8 million. We modified an existing stochastic, spatial simulation model to simulate 64 scenarios for planning and decision-making. Our scenarios simulated four different herd types for the index herd (company feedlot, backgrounder feedlot, large beef, backyard) and variations in three mitigation strategies (time-of-detection, vaccine availability, and surveillance during disease control). Under our assumptions about availability of resources to manage an outbreak, median epidemic lengths in the scenarios with commercial feedlot, backgrounder feedlot, large beef and backyard index herd types ranged from 28 to 52, 19 to 39, 18 to 32, and 18 to 36 days, respectively, and the average number of herds depopulated ranged from 4 to 101, 2 to 29, 1 to 15 and 1 to 18, respectively. Early detection of FMD in the index herd had the largest impact on reducing ( approximately 13-21 days) the length of epidemics and the number of herds ( approximately 5-34) depopulated. Although most predicted epidemics lasted only approximately 1-2 months, and <100 herds needed to be depopulated, large outbreaks lasting approximately 8-9 months with up to 230 herds depopulated might occur.},

title = {Modeling spatial and temporal transmission of foot-and-mouth disease in France: identification of high-risk areas},
abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease is one of the most contagious diseases of animal livestock. We used statistical tools to explore the dynamics of epidemics and to evaluate the consequences of virus reintroduction in France. We developed a stochastic farm-based model adapted to the French farm structure from previous modeling works following the 2001 epidemic in the United Kingdom. This model depends upon the distance between the 280,000 French farms and on species type (e.g. cows and sheep) and it tracks each animal's farm status at any given day. Since data were only available at the town scale, the farm location and the number of animals in each farm were simulated over the surface area of each French town, as well as the number of mixed farms. Based on 200 simulations of the model, our results allowed for the study of local disease transmission, since it begins simulations once limitation of movement is put into place. On average, the same 50 randomly chosen initially infected farms would lead to 1,110 infected farms (610; 1,590) when two control strategies (culling within 0.5 km from an infected farm and vaccination within 3 km) are put into place. Regions with high densities of cows and sheep (e.g. Pays-de-la-Loire) are high-risk zones, confirming that the epidemic process depends upon the location and the type of initially infected farms (size, species type). The results of this model highlight the importance of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to obtain more precise data concerning herds.},

title = {Use of circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) dipsticks for detection of intestinal and urinary schistosomiasis},
abstract = {An evaluation of a commercially available antigen capture dipstick that detects schistosome circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) in urine was conducted in representative endemic areas for intestinal and urinary schistosomiasis in Uganda and Zanzibar, respectively. Under field-based conditions, the sensitivity (SS) and specificity (SP) of the dipstick was 83 and 81% for detection of Schistosoma mansoni infections while positive predictive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were 84%. Light egg-positive infections were sometimes CCA-negative while CCA-positives included egg-negative children. A positive association between faecal egg output and intensity of CCA test band was observed. Estimating prevalence of intestinal schistosomiasis by school with dipsticks was highly correlated (r=0.95) with Kato-Katz stool examinations, typically within +/-8.5%. In Zanzibar, however, dipsticks totally failed to detect S. haematobium despite examining children with egg-patent schistosomiasis. This was also later corroborated by further surveys in Niger and Burkina Faso. Laboratory testing of dipsticks with aqueous adult worm lysates from several reference species showed correct functioning, however, dipsticks failed to detect CCA in urine from S. haematobium-infected hamsters. While CCA dipsticks are a good alternative, or complement, to stool microscopy for field diagnosis of intestinal schistosomiasis, they have no proven value for field diagnosis of urinary schistosomiasis. At approximately 2.6 US dollars per dipstick, they are presently too expensive to be cost-effective for wide scale use in disease mapping surveys unless Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) strategies are developed.},

title = {The role of spatial mixing in the spread of foot-and-mouth disease},
abstract = {A model of epidemic dispersal (based on the assumption that susceptible cattle were homogeneously mixed over space, or non-spatial model) was compared to a partially spatially explicit and discrete model (the spatial model), which was composed of differential equations and used geo-coded data (Euclidean distances between county centroids). While the spatial model accounted for intra- and inter-county epidemic spread, the non-spatial model did not assess regional differences. A geo-coded dataset that resembled conditions favouring homogeneous mixing assumptions (based on the 2001 Uruguayan foot-and-mouth disease epidemic), was used for testing. Significant differences between models were observed in the average transmission rate between farms, both before and after a control policy (animal movement ban) was imposed. They also differed in terms of daily number of infected farms: the non-spatial model revealed a single epidemic peak (at, approximately, 25 epidemic days); while the spatial model revealed two epidemic peaks (at, approximately, 12 and 28 days, respectively). While the spatial model fitted well with the observed cumulative number of infected farms, the non-spatial model did not (P<0.01). In addition, the spatial model: (a) indicated an early intra-county reproductive number R of approximately 87 (falling to <1 within 25 days), and an inter-county R<1; (b) predicted that, if animal movement restrictions had begun 3 days before/after the estimated initiation of such policy, cases would have decreased/increased by 23 or 26%, respectively. Spatial factors (such as inter-farm distance and coverage of vaccination campaigns, absent in non-spatial models) may explain why partially explicit spatial models describe epidemic spread more accurately than non-spatial models even at early epidemic phases. Integration of geo-coded data into mathematical models is recommended.},

abstract = {A ubiquitous quantity in epidemic modelling is the basic reproduction number R(0). This became so popular in the 1990s that 'All you need know is R(0)!' became a familiar catch-phrase. The value of R(0) defines, among other things, the control effort needed to eliminate the infection from a homogeneous host population, but can be misleading when applied to a heterogeneous population for the same purpose. We have defined the type-reproduction number T for an infectious disease, and shown that this not only has the required threshold behaviour, but also correctly determines the critical control effort for heterogeneous populations. The two quantities coincide for homogeneous populations. In this paper we further develop the new threshold quantity as an indicator of control effort required in a system where multiple types of individuals are recognised when control targets a specific type.},

title = {The critical vaccination fraction for heterogeneous epidemic models},
abstract = {Given a population with m heterogeneous subgroups, a method is developed for determining minimal vaccine allocations to prevent an epidemic by setting the reproduction number to 1. The framework is sufficiently general to apply to several epidemic situations, such as SIR, SEIR and SIS models with vital dynamics. The reproduction number is the largest eigenvalue of the linearized system round the local point of equilibrium of the model. Using the Perron-Frobenius theorem, an exact method for generating solutions is given and the threshold surface of critical vaccine allocations is shown to be a compact, connected subset of a regular (m - 1)-dimensional manifold. Populations with two subgroups are examined in full. The threshold curves are either hyperbolas or straight lines. Explicit conditions are given as to when threshold elimination is achievable by vaccinating just one or two groups in a multi-group population and expressions for the critical coverage are derived. Specific reference is made to an influenza A model. Separable or proportionate mixing is also treated. Conditions are conjectured for convexity of the threshold surface and the problem of minimizing the amount of vaccine used while remaining on the threshold surface is discussed.

title = {Prospects for development of a transmission blocking vaccine against Schistosoma japonicum},
abstract = {Despite intensive long-term control programmes, schistosomiasis japonica remains a serious public health problem in China and the Philippines. The termination of mass praziquantel-treatment has seen a dramatic recent rebound in both its prevalence and associated morbidity. Schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonosis but, despite complicating control efforts, this feature provides a practical method for attacking Schistosoma japonicum through development and deployment of a transmission blocking veterinary vaccine. A recently completed bovine drug intervention trial and mathematical modelling of the transmission of S. japonicum underpin the concept that such a vaccine, targeting water buffalo, would have major implications for future integrated schistosomiasis control in China. A major block to success is the low ceiling efficacy achieved with current vaccine molecules. To solve this challenge, an antigen discovery pipeline needs to be established for identification of new vaccine targets that induce greater potency than the current anti-S. japonicum candidate vaccines. Excretory-secretory products and molecules exposed on epithelial surfaces (including receptors) which interact directly with the host immune system warrant especial attention. Extensive schistosome genomics programmes currently underway coupled with new advances in proteomics and microarray technology provide an unparalleled opportunity to identify new molecules exploitable as vaccine targets. These will then need to be produced in quantity and rigorously tested first in the laboratory and then the field. If a transmission blocking veterinary vaccine developed for bovines can be put into practice in combination with other control strategies such as human chemotherapy, elimination of S. japonicum from China may be achievable.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Investigation of the neuraminidase inhibitor sensitivity of influenza B isolates from 74 children before and after oseltamivir therapy and from 348 untreated patients with influenza (including 66 adults) seen at 4 community hospitals in Japan during the 2004-2005 influenza season. Four hundred twenty-two viruses from untreated patients and 74 samples from patients after oseltamivir therapy were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Sialidase inhibition assay was used to test the drug sensitivities of influenza B viruses. The neuraminidase and hemagglutinin genes of viruses showing reduced sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors were sequenced to identify mutations that have the potential to confer reduced sensitivity to these drugs. RESULTS: In 1 (1.4%) of the 74 children who had received oseltamivir, we identified a variant with reduced drug sensitivity possessing a Gly402Ser neuraminidase substitution. We also identified variants with reduced sensitivity carrying an Asp198Asn, Ile222Thr, or Ser250Gly mutation in 7 (1.7%) of the 422 viruses from untreated patients. Review of the clinical and viral genetic information available on these 7 patients indicated that 4 were likely infected in a community setting, while the remaining 3 were probably infected through contact with siblings shedding the mutant viruses. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, influenza B viruses with reduced sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors do not arise as frequently as resistant influenza A viruses. However, they appear to be transmitted within communities and families, requiring continued close monitoring.},

title = {International approach to eradication and surveillance for foot-and-mouth disease in the Americas},
abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) was introduced into the Americas in 1870. At that time the disease was described simultaneously in the North coast of the United States of North America, the Province of Buenos Aires in Argentina, the central region of Chile, Uruguay, and South Brazil. At the beginning of the twentieth century the disease spread to the rest of Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Per{\'u}. In 1950 the disease was introduced into Venezuela, and in the same year to Colombia, and from there to Ecuador. The United States of America eradicated an outbreak of FMD in 1929. Outbreaks of FMD were also eradicated from Mexico in 1947 and from Canada in 1952. The last outbreak that occurred in Mexico in 1954 was also eradicated. In 1951 the Americas Animal Health Authorities decided to establish a Pan-American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Center (PANAFTOSA), initially as a special program within the American States Organization (OAS). The center was later transferred to the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO). In the early 1970s PANAFTOSA developed a proposal for a continental surveillance system for vesicular diseases, which was approved by Agriculture Ministers at an International Meeting for FMD and Zoonoses (RICAZ). Since then, PANAFTOSA dedicated all efforts to collaborate with each country in the implementation of the system and to receive, analyze, and distribute a weekly report of vesicular diseases. The model was elaborated using coordinate grid maps, one for the South American Continent, others for each country in the region. The reports from each country consist of the grid location for any suspicious outbreak of vesicular disease. Using the information gathered during visits to the countries, as well as weekly reports, and by studying the most frequent animal movements within the region, PANAFTOSA developed a proposal for FMD eradication. This plan was approved by the Government of South America and implemented in cooperation with PANAFTOSA. The hemispheric plan for FMD eradication (PHEFA), has been implemented and today Chile and Uruguay are FMD free without vaccination; Argentina, Paraguay, and the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina in Brazil are also recognized by the OIE to be FMD Free, with vaccination. The use of the continental surveillance system is the main strategy for achieving the eradication of FMD in South America. At this time PANAFTOSA is working to improve the system, and to add other diseases indicated by the governments of the Americas.},

title = {Social ties and susceptibility to the common cold},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the hypothesis that diverse ties to friends, family, work, and community are associated with increased host resistance to infection. DESIGN: After reporting the extent of participation in 12 types of social ties (eg, spouse, parent, friend, workmate, member of social group), subjects were given nasal drops containing 1 of 2 rhinoviruses and monitored for the development of a common cold. SETTING: Quarantine. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 276 healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 55 years, neither seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus nor pregnant. OUTCOME MEASURES: Colds (illness in the presence of a verified infection), mucus production, mucociliary clearance function, and amount of viral replication. RESULTS: In response to both viruses, those with more types of social ties were less susceptible to common colds, produced less mucus, were more effective in ciliary clearance of their nasal passages, and shed less virus. These relationships were unaltered by statistical controls for prechallenge virus-specific antibody, virus type, age, sex, season, body mass index, education, and race. Susceptibility to colds decreased in a dose-response manner with increased diversity of the social network. There was an adjusted relative risk of 4.2 comparing persons with fewest (1 to 3) to those with most (6 or more) types of social ties. Although smoking, poor sleep quality, alcohol abstinence, low dietary intake of vitamin C, elevated catecholamine levels, and being introverted were all associated with greater susceptibility to colds, they could only partially account for the relation between social network diversity and incidence of colds. CONCLUSIONS: More diverse social networks were associated with greater resistance to upper respiratory illness.},

abstract = {Hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) and neutralization are used to evaluate vaccines against influenza virus A (H5N1); however, poor standardization leads to interlaboratory variation of results. A candidate antibody standard (07/150) was prepared from pooled plasma of persons given clade 1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine. To test human and sheep antiserum, 15 laboratories used HI and neutralization and reassortant A/Vietnam/1194/2004, A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (clade 2.2), and A/Anhui/1/2005 (clade 2.3.4) viruses. Interlaboratory variation was observed for both assays, but when titers were expressed relative to 07/150, overall percentage geometric coefficient of variation for A/Vietnam/1194/2004 was reduced from 125% to 61% for HI and from 183% to 81% for neutralization. Lack of reduced variability to clade 2 antigens suggested the need for clade-specific standards. Sheep antiserum as a standard did not reliably reduce variability. The World Health Organization has established 07/150 as an international standard for antibody to clade 1 subtype H5 and has an assigned potency of 1,000 IU/ampoule.},

title = {Frequent transmission of immunodeficiency viruses among bobcats and pumas},
abstract = {With the exception of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which emerged in humans after cross-species transmissions of simian immunodeficiency viruses from nonhuman primates, immunodeficiency viruses of the family Lentiviridae represent species-specific viruses that rarely cross species barriers to infect new hosts. Among the Felidae, numerous immunodeficiency-like lentiviruses have been documented, but only a few cross-species transmissions have been recorded, and these have not been perpetuated in the recipient species. Lentivirus seroprevalence was determined for 79 bobcats (Lynx rufus) and 31 pumas (Puma concolor) from well-defined populations in Southern California. Partial genomic sequences were subsequently obtained from 18 and 12 seropositive bobcats and pumas, respectively. Genotypes were analyzed for phylogenic relatedness and genotypic composition among the study set and archived feline lentivirus sequences. This investigation of feline immunodeficiency virus infection in bobcats and pumas of Southern California provides evidence that cross-species infection has occurred frequently among these animals. The data suggest that transmission has occurred in multiple locations and are most consistent with the spread of the virus from bobcats to pumas. Although the ultimate causes remain unknown, these transmission events may occur as a result of puma predation on bobcats, a situation similar to that which fostered transmission of HIV to humans, and likely represent the emergence of a lentivirus with relaxed barriers to cross-species transmission. This unusual observation provides a valuable opportunity to evaluate the ecological, behavioral, and molecular conditions that favor repeated transmissions and persistence of lentivirus between species.},

title = {Dynamic effects of antibody-dependent enhancement on the fitness of viruses},
abstract = {Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a phenomenon in which viral replication is increased rather than decreased by immune sera, has been observed in vitro for a large number of viruses of public health importance, including flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and retroviruses. The most striking in vivo example of ADE in humans is dengue hemorrhagic fever, a disease in which ADE is thought to increase the severity of clinical manifestations of dengue virus infection by increasing virus replication. We examine the epidemiological impact of ADE on the prevalence and persistence of viral serotypes. Using a dynamical system model of n cocirculating dengue serotypes, we find that ADE may provide a competitive advantage to those serotypes that undergo enhancement compared with those that do not, and that this advantage increases with increasing numbers of cocirculating serotypes. Paradoxically, there are limits to the selective advantage provided by increasing levels of ADE, because greater levels of enhancement induce large amplitude oscillations in incidence of all dengue virus infections, threatening the persistence of both the enhanced and nonenhanced serotypes. Although the models presented here are specifically designed for dengue, our results are applicable to any epidemiological system in which partial immunity increases pathogen replication rates. Our results suggest that enhancement is most advantageous in settings where multiple serotypes circulate and where a large host population is available to support pathogen persistence during the deep troughs of ADE-induced large amplitude oscillations of virus replication.},

The frequency of these rises in titer increased gradually and significantly as the time of emergence of the H3N2 virus approached. Occasional rises in Hsw1 antibody titer and presence of such antibody in sera obtained from young children were also detected in specimens collected at that time. In pre-vaccination 1976 serum collection, the prevalence of antibody against Hsw1N2 was significantly higher in certain age groups than that found in 1966-1968. During the 1976-1977 period, evidence for increase in H1N1 antibody frequency was found in nonvaccinated children, again before the emergence of the H1N1 strain.

title = {Antiviral resistance and the control of pandemic influenza: the roles of stochasticity, evolution and model details},
abstract = {Antiviral drugs, most notably the neuraminidase inhibitors, are an important component of control strategies aimed to prevent or limit any future influenza pandemic. The potential large-scale use of antiviral drugs brings with it the danger of drug resistance evolution. A number of recent studies have shown that the emergence of drug-resistant influenza could undermine the usefulness of antiviral drugs for the control of an epidemic or pandemic outbreak. While these studies have provided important insights, the inherently stochastic nature of resistance generation and spread, as well as the potential for ongoing evolution of the resistant strain have not been fully addressed. Here, we study a stochastic model of drug resistance emergence and consecutive evolution of the resistant strain in response to antiviral control during an influenza pandemic. We find that taking into consideration the ongoing evolution of the resistant strain does not increase the probability of resistance emergence; however, it increases the total number of infecteds if a resistant outbreak occurs. Our study further shows that taking stochasticity into account leads to results that can differ from deterministic models. Specifically, we find that rapid and strong control cannot only contain a drug sensitive outbreak, it can also prevent a resistant outbreak from occurring. We find that the best control strategy is early intervention heavily based on prophylaxis at a level that leads to outbreak containment. If containment is not possible, mitigation works best at intermediate levels of antiviral control. Finally, we show that the results are not very sensitive to the way resistance generation is modeled.},

abstract = {The mechanisms responsible for the virulence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus in humans remain poorly understood. To identify crucial components of the early host response during these infections by using both conventional and functional genomics tools, we studied 34 cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) to compare a 2004 human H5N1 Vietnam isolate with 2 reassortant viruses possessing the 1918 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface proteins, known conveyors of virulence. One of the reassortants also contained the 1918 nonstructural (NS1) protein, an inhibitor of the host interferon response. Among these viruses, HPAI H5N1 was the most virulent. Within 24 h, the H5N1 virus produced severe bronchiolar and alveolar lesions. Notably, the H5N1 virus targeted type II pneumocytes throughout the 7-day infection, and induced the most dramatic and sustained expression of type I interferons and inflammatory and innate immune genes, as measured by genomic and protein assays. The H5N1 infection also resulted in prolonged margination of circulating T lymphocytes and notable apoptosis of activated dendritic cells in the lungs and draining lymph nodes early during infection. While both 1918 reassortant viruses also were highly pathogenic, the H5N1 virus was exceptional for the extent of tissue damage, cytokinemia, and interference with immune regulatory mechanisms, which may help explain the extreme virulence of HPAI viruses in humans.},

Respiratory syncytial viruses continued to be limited in appearance to relatively brief periods. Rates of isolation of parainfluenzaviruses and respiratory syncytial viruses demonstrated their importance in reinfections of older children and adults.

The corresponding reductions predicted for influenza B were 25-35%, 44-69% and 85-96%, respectively. These results are sensitive to assumptions about contact patterns and several parameters, including the vaccine efficacy among those aged <24 months, require further study.

title = {Delaying the international spread of pandemic influenza},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of hypervirulent subtypes of avian influenza has underlined the potentially devastating effects of pandemic influenza. Were such a virus to acquire the ability to spread efficiently between humans, control would almost certainly be hampered by limited vaccine supplies unless global spread could be substantially delayed. Moreover, the large increases that have occurred in international air travel might be expected to lead to more rapid global dissemination than in previous pandemics. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To evaluate the potential of local control measures and travel restrictions to impede global dissemination, we developed stochastic models of the international spread of influenza based on extensions of coupled epidemic transmission models. These models have been shown to be capable of accurately forecasting local and global spread of epidemic and pandemic influenza. We show that under most scenarios restrictions on air travel are likely to be of surprisingly little value in delaying epidemics, unless almost all travel ceases very soon after epidemics are detected. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to reduce local transmission of influenza are likely to be more effective at reducing the rate of global spread and less vulnerable to implementation delays than air travel restrictions. Nevertheless, under the most plausible scenarios, achievable delays are small compared with the time needed to accumulate substantial vaccine stocks.},

Although there was remarkable correspondence between antigenic and genetic evolution, significant differences were observed: Antigenic evolution was more punctuated than genetic evolution, and genetic change sometimes had a disproportionately large antigenic effect. The method readily allows monitoring of antigenic differences among vaccine and circulating strains and thus estimation of the effects of vaccination. Further, this approach offers a route to predicting the relative success of emerging strains, which could be achieved by quantifying the combined effects of population level immune escape and viral fitness on strain evolution.},

abstract = {Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) intended to reduce infectious contacts between persons form an integral part of plans to mitigate the impact of the next influenza pandemic. Although the potential benefits of NPIs are supported by mathematical models, the historical evidence for the impact of such interventions in past pandemics has not been systematically examined. We obtained data on the timing of 19 classes of NPI in 17 U.S. cities during the 1918 pandemic and tested the hypothesis that early implementation of multiple interventions was associated with reduced disease transmission. Consistent with this hypothesis, cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates approximately 50% lower than those that did not and had less-steep epidemic curves. Cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic also showed a trend toward lower cumulative excess mortality, but the difference was smaller (approximately 20%) and less statistically significant than that for peak death rates. This finding was not unexpected, given that few cities maintained NPIs longer than 6 weeks in 1918. Early implementation of certain interventions, including closure of schools, churches, and theaters, was associated with lower peak death rates, but no single intervention showed an association with improved aggregate outcomes for the 1918 phase of the pandemic. These findings support the hypothesis that rapid implementation of multiple NPIs can significantly reduce influenza transmission, but that viral spread will be renewed upon relaxation of such measures.},

Mathematical models were used to study the time delay between epidemics in 2 population centers when travel restrictions were imposed. The models demonstrated that population size, travel rates, and places where travelers reside can strongly influence delay. The model simulations suggested that moderate delays in geographic spread may be possible with stringent restrictions and a low reproduction number, but results will be sensitive to the reproduction number and timing of restrictions. Model limitations include the absence of further importations and additional control measures. Internal border control may have a role in protecting domestic centers early in a pandemic, when importations are sparse. Our results may be useful for policymakers.},

title = {DNA-based vaccines protect against zoonotic schistosomiasis in water buffalo},
abstract = {Schistosomiasis japonica is an endemic, zoonotic disease of major public health importance in China where water buffaloes account for approximately 75% of disease transmission. Interventions that reduce schistosome infection in water buffaloes will enhance their health simultaneously reducing disease transmission to humans. While chemotherapy has proved successful, it requires continued time consuming and expensive mass treatments. A more sustainable option would be development of vaccines that reduce transmission of S. japonicum from bovines to replace bovine chemotherapy. We performed two randomized double blind trials in water buffaloes to determine if DNA vaccines encoding triose-phosphate isomerase (SjCTPI), or the tetraspanin 23 kDa integral membrane protein (SjC23), alone or fused to bovine heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) could induce a level of immunity conducive to long-term sustainable control. Groups of water buffaloes (15/group) received three intramuscular injections, 4 weeks apart. Booster immunizations were co-administered with a plasmid DNA encoding IL-12. Four weeks after the last injection, water buffaloes were challenged with 1000 cercariae, and vaccine efficacy analyzed 8 weeks later. Water buffaloes vaccinated with SjCTPI-Hsp70 or SjCTPI plasmids had worm burdens reduced by 51.2% and 41.5%, respectively. Importantly, fecal miracidial hatching was reduced by 52.1% and 33.2% respectively compared to control vaccinated water buffaloes. Vaccination with SjC23-Hsp70 and SjC23 plasmids reduced worm burdens by 50.9% and 45.5%, respectively, and fecal miracidial hatching by 52.0% and 47.4%. A mathematical model of schistosome transmission predicts that schistosome vaccines capable of reducing water buffaloes' fecal egg output by 45%, alone or in conjunction with praziquantel treatment, will lead to a significant reduction in transmission of schistosomiasis. Both DNA vaccines tested here exceed this hypothetical level. Indeed, mathematical modeling of SjCTPI-Hsp70 and SjC23-Hsp70 alone and in conjunction with human chemotherapy showed a significant reduction in transmission almost to the point of elimination.},

title = {Using models to identify routes of nosocomial infection: a large hospital outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong},
abstract = {Two factors dominated the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2002-2003 global outbreak, namely super-spreading events (SSE) and hospital infections. Although both factors were important during the first and the largest hospital outbreak in Hong Kong, the relative importance of different routes of infection has not yet been quantified. We estimated the parameters of a novel mathematical model of hospital infection using SARS episode data. These estimates described levels of transmission between the index super-spreader, staff and patients, and were used to compare three plausible hypotheses. The broadest of the supported hypotheses ascribes the initial surge in cases to a single super-spreading individual and suggests that the per capita risk of infection to patients increased approximately one month after the start of the outbreak. Our estimate for the number of cases caused by the SSE is substantially lower than the previously reported values, which were mostly based on self-reported exposure information. This discrepancy suggests that the early identification of the index case as a super-spreader might have led to biased contact tracing, resulting in too few cases being attributed to staff-to-staff transmission. We propose that in future outbreaks of SARS or other directly transmissible respiratory pathogens, simple mathematical models could be used to validate preliminary conclusions concerning the relative importance of different routes of transmission with important implications for infection control.},

The sample population from the Tecumseh Respiratory Illness Study is mapped into the simulation model and simulations are carried out over a range of parameter values and conditions, some of which were derived from influenza seasons in Tecumseh and from the Seattle Flu Study for the years 1975-1980. The estimation procedure is found to be quite robust for parameter values preset within appropriate limits for influenza. However, a significant difference is found between the preset and estimated household contact parameter for epidemics of medium and high intensity when the preset value is zero. Incremental increases in the household contact parameter are shown to produce marked increases in the overall infection attack rate demonstrating that household spread is an important link in maintaining infection in other mixing groups such as schools, preschool groups and neighbourhood clusters of households.},

title = {Potential infections of H5N1 and H9N2 avian influenza do exist in Guangdong populations of China},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Southeast China is one of the sites of influenza origin. During 2003--2004, nine avian influenza outbreaks took place in Guangdong Province. But no human case was reported. To examine the status of potential human infection by human influenza (H1N1, H3N2) and avian influenza (H5N1, H7N7, H9N2) in the avian influenza epidemic area of Guangdong Province, China, we conducted a seroepidemiologic survey in the people of this area from April to June of 2004. METHODS: Three out of 9 H5N1 avian influenza affected poultry areas in Guangdong were randomly selected, and the population living within 3 kilometers of the affected poultries were chosen as the survey subjects. One thousand two hundred and fourteen people were selected from 3 villages at random. Human and avian influenza antibody titers were determined by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test and microneutralization test (MNT). RESULTS: The positive rate of antibody to H5N1 was 3.03% in the occupational exposure group and 2.34% in general citizens group; that of H9N2 was 9.52% in the occupational exposure group and 3.76% in the general citizens group. Moreover one case in the occupational exposure group was positive for H7N7. One year later, all previously positive cases had become negative except for one H5N1-positive case. CONCLUSION: The observations imply that H5N1 and H9N2 avian influenza silent infections exist in Guangdong populations.},

Specifically, we present an analysis of the dynamics of disease outbreaks for three common communicable infections from a small isolated island population. The strongly fluctuating nature of the temporal incidence of disease is captured by the model, and comparisons between exponents calculated from the data and from simulations are made. A forest-fire model with sparks is used to classify the observed scaling dynamics of the epidemics and provides a unified picture of the epidemiology which conventional epidemiological analysis is unable to reproduce. This study suggests that power-law scaling can emerge in natural systems when they are driven on widely separated time-scales, in accordance with recent analytic renormalization group calculations.},

title = {Building and evaluating models to estimate ambient population density},
abstract = {The concept of human population density is quite simple: the number of persons occupying a given area. Nonetheless, practical representations of population density must use appropriate spatial and temporal scales of measurement to be useful. The 11 September 2001 attack on the World Trade Center in New York is a poignant example: "How many people were in the two World Trade Center buildings at 0830 local time?" Population density data derived from most-national censuses is a residential measure of population density and consequently does not capture non-residential population density. Human mobility suggests that a nonresidential or ambient measure of population density may be a more useful representation for some applications. Ambient population density in this sense is a temporally averaged measure of population density that takes into account where people work, sleep, eat, drive, shop, etc. Short of implanting a GPS reciever into everyone's skull and tracking their spatio-temporal behavior, it is extremely difficult to make direct measurements of ambient population density. This paper explores some theoretical and empirical efforts at estimating ambient population density and proposes a quantitative means for evaluating their validity. The three models of population density examined are LandScan, Gridded Population of the World (GPW), and a simple empirical model derived from nighttime satellite imagery provided by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS). These measures are compared to both residential and employment-based measures of population density in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The GPW, LandScan, and DMSP OLS models of ambient population density described here all make foundational contributions to future efforts at filling the gap in social, economic, and demographic information for parts of the world where such data are unavailable. The proxy measures of population density described here show promise for many applications, including improved mapping of population distribution and as a supplement to census enumerations in many parts of the world.},

title = {Emergence of a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus in humans},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: On April 15 and April 17, 2009, novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) was identified in specimens obtained from two epidemiologically unlinked patients in the United States. The same strain of the virus was identified in Mexico, Canada, and elsewhere. We describe 642 confirmed cases of human S-OIV infection identified from the rapidly evolving U.S. outbreak. METHODS: Enhanced surveillance was implemented in the United States for human infection with influenza A viruses that could not be subtyped. Specimens were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction confirmatory testing for S-OIV. RESULTS: From April 15 through May 5, a total of 642 confirmed cases of S-OIV infection were identified in 41 states. The ages of patients ranged from 3 months to 81 years; 60% of patients were 18 years of age or younger. Of patients with available data, 18% had recently traveled to Mexico, and 16% were identified from school outbreaks of S-OIV infection. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (94% of patients), cough (92%), and sore throat (66%); 25% of patients had diarrhea, and 25% had vomiting. Of the 399 patients for whom hospitalization status was known, 36 (9%) required hospitalization. Of 22 hospitalized patients with available data, 12 had characteristics that conferred an increased risk of severe seasonal influenza, 11 had pneumonia, 8 required admission to an intensive care unit, 4 had respiratory failure, and 2 died. The S-OIV was determined to have a unique genome composition that had not been identified previously. CONCLUSIONS: A novel swine-origin influenza A virus was identified as the cause of outbreaks of febrile respiratory infection ranging from self-limited to severe illness. It is likely that the number of confirmed cases underestimates the number of cases that have occurred.},

In this study, we reported avian-like H1N1 and novel ressortant H1N2 influenza viruses from pigs in China. Homology and phylogenetic analyses showed that the H1N1 virus (A/swine/Zhejiang/1/07) was closely to avian-like H1N1 viruses and seemed to be derived from the European swine H1N1 viruses, which was for the first time reported in China; and the two H1N2 viruses (A/swine/Shanghai/1/07 and A/swine/Guangxi/13/06) were novel ressortant H1N2 influenza viruses containing genes from the classical swine (HA, NP, M and NS), human (NA and PB1) and avian (PB2 and PA) lineages, which indicted that the reassortment among human, avian, and swine influenza viruses had taken place in pigs in China and resulted in the generation of new viruses. The isolation of avian-like H1N1 influenza virus originated from the European swine H1N1 viruses, especially the emergence of two novel ressortant H1N2 influenza viruses provides further evidence that pigs serve as intermediate hosts or "mixing vessels", and swine influenza virus surveillance in China should be given a high priority.},

title = {Modelling the 1985 influenza epidemic in France},
abstract = {The Rvachev-Baroyan-Longini model is a space-time predictive model of the spread of influenza epidemics. It has been applied to 128 cities of the USSR, and more recently, to forecasting the spread of the pandemic of 1968-1969 throughout 52 large cities. It is a deterministic, mass-action, space and time continuous model. The model has been applied to the simulation of the influenza epidemic of 1984-1985 in the 22 French Metropolitan districts and results are presented. Estimates of the parameters of the model were made using the French Communicable Diseases Network data. These parameters are the contact rate, a, (estimate = 0.55) which is the number of people with whom an infectious individual will make contact daily sufficient to pass infection and the infectious period, 1/b, estimated as 2.49 days. The mean annual railroad passenger traffic from district i to district j varies from 0 to 1,991,000 persons depending on the districts. The computer spread of the epidemic is presented on weekly maps. Results are also presented on district charts, giving the size of district epidemics and the time of peak of the epidemic. The precision of the computer fittings was judged satisfactory by the calculated size of peak differing from the real one by less than 100 per cent, in 17 out of 18 districts, and by the calculated time of peak differing from the observed by less than two weeks in 14 out of 18 districts. Although precision could be improved with more detailed information about passenger traffic, the French use of the model has been satisfactory.},

title = {Antiviral effects on influenza viral transmission and pathogenicity: observations from household-based trials},
abstract = {Four household-based, randomized clinical trials, two each of zanamivir and oseltamivir, were designed primarily to estimate the effect of postexposure prophylaxis on preventing influenza illness in household contacts. However, the effect of influenza antivirals on infectiousness as well as on the ability of the virus to cause disease--the pathogenicity--have important public health consequences. The authors show how such studies can provide estimates of pathogenicity, antiviral efficacy for pathogenicity, and the antiviral effect on infectiousness. Analysis of the four studies confirmed the high prophylactic efficacy against illness of both zanamivir (75%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 54, 86) and oseltamivir (81%, 95% CI: 35, 94). The effect on reducing infectiousness was 19% (95% CI: -160, 75) for zanamivir and 80% (95% CI: 43, 93) for oseltamivir. Pathogenicity in controls ranged from 44% (95% CI: 33, 55) to 66% (95% CI: 48, 72). Efficacy in reducing pathogenicity for zanamivir was 52% (95% CI: 19, 72) and 56% (95% CI: 14, 77) in the two studies; for oseltamivir, it was 56% (95% CI: 10, 73) and 79% (95% CI: 45, 92). Studies of influenza antivirals in transmission units would be improved if randomization schemes were used that allow estimation of the antiviral effect on infectiousness from individual studies.},

abstract = {The 1918 "Spanish flu" was the fastest spreading and most deadly influenza pandemic in recorded history. Hypotheses of its origin have been based on a limited collection of case and outbreak reports from before its recognized European emergence in the summer of 1918. These anecdotal accounts, however, remain insufficient for determining the early diffusion and impact of the pandemic virus. Using routinely collected monthly age-stratified mortality data, we show that an unmistakable shift in the age distribution of epidemic deaths occurred during the 1917/1918 influenza season in New York City. The timing, magnitude, and age distribution of this mortality shift provide strong evidence that an early wave of the pandemic virus was present in New York City during February-April 1918.},

abstract = {We use a lattice-based epidemic model to study the spatial and temporal rates of disease spread in a spatially distributed host population. The prevalence of the disease in the population is studied as well as the spread of infection about a point source of infection. In particular, two distinct critical population densities are identified. The first relates to the minimum population density for a epidemic to occur, whilst the second is the minimum population density for long-term persistence to occur. Vaccination regimes are introduced that are used to measure the impact of spatially and nonspatially dependent intervention strategies. Specifically we show how a ring of vaccinated susceptibles, of sufficient thickness, can halt the spread of infection across space.},

title = {Heterosubtypic immunity to influenza A virus: where do we stand?},
abstract = {Influenza A virus (IAV) strains are denoted by the subtype of their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) virion surface proteins. Major changes in HA subtype among strains circulating in humans are referred to as "antigenic shift". Antigenic shift can occur by two means: direct transmission of a zoonotic strain to humans or through reshuffling of the segmented genome in cells co-infected with animal and human strains. The lack of circulating anti-HA antibodies in human populations to a novel IAV results in extremely high frequency of illness and the potential for severe morbidity and mortality on a world-wide basis; the dreaded pandemic. Such pandemics could be partially controlled by developing a vaccine that generates effective heterosubtypic immunity (HSI) based on immune recognition of IAV antigens conserved across all viral strains. While it has long been known that T cells exhibit such broad cross-reactive specificity that could provide effective HSI, recent animal studies suggest a potential role for antibodies as well. Here we review current knowledge of the mechanisms contributing to HSI to influenza and speculate on the potential for this approach to contribute to public health.},

Virus transmission characteristics will not be completely known in advance, but difficulties in influenza control typically include peak infectivity early in illness, a short interval between cases, and to a lesser extent, transmission from persons with incubating or asymptomatic infection. Screening and quarantining entering travelers at international borders did not substantially delay virus introduction in past pandemics, except in some island countries, and will likely be even less effective in the modern era. Instead, WHO recommends providing information to international travelers and possibly screening travelers departing countries with transmissible human infection. The principal focus of interventions against pandemic influenza spread should be at national and community levels rather than international borders.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that has recently attracted increased focus and funding for control. Despite shifts in global health policy towards the implementation of mass chemotherapeutic control programmes at the national scale in sub-Saharan Africa, however, many challenges still exist. RECENT FINDINGS: Publications reviewed for this article cover: the development of treatment strategies; the planning, implementation and impact of control programmes; the re-evaluation of the burden of schistosomiasis; improved tools for control; new drugs; the safety of treatment during pregnancy; and the development of resistance against praziquantel. SUMMARY: The morbidity due to schistosomiasis has been shown to be greater than was previously thought. The reduction in morbidity of schistosomiasis by control programmes has been demonstrated, while new tools include a validated dose pole for delivering the correct treatment, geographical information systems mapping for determining high-risk areas, and Lot Quality Assurance Sampling for determining treatment strategies at the local level. Sustainability and future funding are issues to be addressed. Despite some positive results, myrrh is apparently ineffective against schistosomiasis, but fortunately no resistance to praziquantel has developed. We predict the impact of schistosomiasis control will be a healthier generation of children within 5 years.},

In a ferret pathogenesis and transmission model, the 2009 A(H1N1) virus was found to be more pathogenic than a seasonal A(H1N1) virus, with more extensive virus replication occurring in the respiratory tract. Replication of seasonal A(H1N1) virus was confined to the nasal cavity of ferrets, but 2009 A(H1N1) also replicated in the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. Virus shedding was more abundant from the upper respiratory tract for 2009 A(H1N1) virus by comparison with seasonal virus, and transmission via aerosol or respiratory droplets was equally efficient. These data suggest that the 2009 A(H1N1) virus has the ability to persist in the human population, potentially with more severe clinical consequences.},

We use a mathematical model, structured on the location at which infection occurs and based on published parameters for influenza, to describe an epidemic in a community of one million people. The model is then modified to reflect a variety of control strategies based on social distancing measures, targeted antiviral treatment and antiviral prophylaxis and home quarantine, and the effectiveness of the strategies is compared. The results suggest that the only single strategy that would be successful in preventing an epidemic (with R0=2.0) is targeted antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, and that closing schools combined with either closing work places or home quarantine would only prevent such an epidemic if these strategies were combined with a modest level of antiviral coverage.},

title = {Hedging against antiviral resistance during the next influenza pandemic using small stockpiles of an alternative chemotherapy},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of single-drug antiviral interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality during the next influenza pandemic will be substantially weakened if transmissible strains emerge which are resistant to the stockpiled antiviral drugs. We developed a mathematical model to test the hypothesis that a small stockpile of a secondary antiviral drug could be used to mitigate the adverse consequences of the emergence of resistant strains. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a multistrain stochastic transmission model of influenza to show that the spread of antiviral resistance can be significantly reduced by deploying a small stockpile (1% population coverage) of a secondary drug during the early phase of local epidemics. We considered two strategies for the use of the secondary stockpile: early combination chemotherapy (ECC; individuals are treated with both drugs in combination while both are available); and sequential multidrug chemotherapy (SMC; individuals are treated only with the secondary drug until it is exhausted, then treated with the primary drug). We investigated all potentially important regions of unknown parameter space and found that both ECC and SMC reduced the cumulative attack rate (AR) and the resistant attack rate (RAR) unless the probability of emergence of resistance to the primary drug p(A) was so low (less than 1 in 10,000) that resistance was unlikely to be a problem or so high (more than 1 in 20) that resistance emerged as soon as primary drug monotherapy began. For example, when the basic reproductive number was 1.8 and 40% of symptomatic individuals were treated with antivirals, AR and RAR were 67% and 38% under monotherapy if p(A) = 0.01. If the probability of resistance emergence for the secondary drug was also 0.01, then SMC reduced AR and RAR to 57% and 2%. The effectiveness of ECC was similar if combination chemotherapy reduced the probabilities of resistance emergence by at least ten times. We extended our model using travel data between 105 large cities to investigate the robustness of these resistance-limiting strategies at a global scale. We found that as long as populations that were the main source of resistant strains employed these strategies (SMC or ECC), then those same strategies were also effective for populations far from the source even when some intermediate populations failed to control resistance. In essence, through the existence of many wild-type epidemics, the interconnectedness of the global network dampened the international spread of resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the augmentation of existing stockpiles of a single anti-influenza drug with smaller stockpiles of a second drug could be an effective and inexpensive epidemiological hedge against antiviral resistance if either SMC or ECC were used. Choosing between these strategies will require additional empirical studies. Specifically, the choice will depend on the safety of combination therapy and the synergistic effect of one antiviral in suppressing the emergence of resistance to the other antiviral when both are taken in combination.},

abstract = {Antigenic profiles of post-2002 H5N1 viruses representing major genetic clades and various geographic sources were investigated using a panel of 17 monoclonal antibodies raised from five H5N1 strains. Four antigenic groups from seven clades of H5N1 virus were distinguished and characterized based on their cross-reactivity to the monoclonal antibodies in hemagglutination inhibition and cell-based neutralization assays. Genetic polymorphisms associated with the variation of antigenicity of H5N1 strains were identified and further verified in antigenic analysis with recombinant H5N1 viruses carrying specific mutations in the hemagglutinin protein. Modification of some of these genetic variations produced marked improvement to the immunogenicity and cross-reactivity of H5N1 strains in assays utilizing monoclonal antibodies and ferret antisera raised against clade 1 and 2 H5N1 viruses, suggesting that these sites represent antigenically significant amino acids. These results provide a comprehensive antigenic profile for H5N1 virus strains circulating in recent years and will facilitate the recognition of emerging antigenic variants of H5N1 virus and aid in the selection of vaccine strains.},

title = {The interval between successive cases of an infectious disease},
abstract = {The interval between successive cases of an infectious disease is determined by the time from infection to infectiousness, the duration of infectiousness, the time from infection to disease onset (incubation period), the duration of any extra-human phase of the infectious agent, and the proportion clinically affected among infected individuals. The interval is important in the interpretation of infectious disease surveillance and trend data, in the identification of outbreaks, and in the optimization of quarantine and contact tracing. This paper discusses the properties of these intervals, as measured between transmission events or between clinical onsets of successive infected individuals, noting the determinants of their ranges and frequency distributions, the circumstances under which secondary cases may arise before primaries, and under which the infection transmission interval will be different from the interval between clinical onsets of successive cases. It discusses the derivation of interval distribution statistics from descriptive data given in standard textbooks, with illustrations from published data on outbreaks, households, and epidemiologic tracing. Finally, it discusses the implications of such measures for studies of secondary attack rates, for the persistence of infection in human communities, for outbreak response, and for elimination or eradication programs.},

title = {Hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia in the elderly: age- and sex-related patterns of care and outcome in the United States},
abstract = {Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a frequent cause of hospital admission and death among elderly patients, but there is little information on age- and sex-specific incidence, patterns of care (intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation), resource use (length of stay and hospital costs), and outcome (mortality). We conducted an observational cohort study of all Medicare recipients, aged 65 years or older, hospitalized in nonfederal U.S. hospitals in 1997, who met ICD-9-CM-based criteria for CAP. We identified 623,718 hospital admissions for CAP (18.3 per 1,000 population > or = 65 years), of which 26,476 (4.3%) were from nursing homes and of which 66,045 (10.6%) died. The incidence rose five-fold and mortality doubled as age increased from 65-69 to older than 90 years. Men had a higher mortality, both unadjusted (odds ratio [OR]: 1.21 [95% CI: 1.19-1.23]) and adjusted for age, location before admission, underlying comorbidity, and microbiologic etiology (OR: 1.15 [95% CI: 1.13-1.17]). Mean hospital length of stay and costs per hospital admission were 7.6 days and {\$}6,949. For those admitted to the intensive care unit (22.4%) and for those receiving mechanical ventilation (7.2%), mean length of stay and costs were 11.3 days and {\$}14,294, and 15.7 days and {\$}23,961, respectively. Overall hospital costs were {\$}4.4 billion (6.3% of the expenditure in the elderly for acute hospital care), of which {\$}2.1 billion was incurred by cases managed in intensive care units. We conclude that in the hospitalized elderly, CAP is a common and frequently fatal disease that often requires intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation and consumes considerable health care resources. The sex differences are of concern and require further investigation.},

We use four infection intensity classes to investigate the impact of ecologic changes and public health interventions on the burden of infection within communities. Age- and sex-specific infection data from three disease-endemic villages in the Philippines are used to estimate the parameters of the model. The model gives good qualitative agreement with observed fecal egg counts adjusted for the accuracy of the Kato-Katz examination. Our results suggest that differences in infection burden between villages are caused by differences in both the infection process and the recovery process in humans. We describe the potential impact of mass treatment of all humans on the numbers with high infection. Furthermore, we show that a sudden reduction in snail population size would affect high prevalence and low prevalence communities in different ways.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are sparse data on whether non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce the spread of influenza. We implemented a study of the feasibility and efficacy of face masks and hand hygiene to reduce influenza transmission among Hong Kong household members. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of households (composed of at least 3 members) where an index subject presented with influenza-like-illness of <48 hours duration. After influenza was confirmed in an index case by the QuickVue Influenza A+B rapid test, the household of the index subject was randomized to 1) control or 2) surgical face masks or 3) hand hygiene. Households were visited within 36 hours, and 3, 6 and 9 days later. Nose and throat swabs were collected from index subjects and all household contacts at each home visit and tested by viral culture. The primary outcome measure was laboratory culture confirmed influenza in a household contact; the secondary outcome was clinically diagnosed influenza (by self-reported symptoms). We randomized 198 households and completed follow up home visits in 128; the index cases in 122 of those households had laboratory-confirmed influenza. There were 21 household contacts with laboratory confirmed influenza corresponding to a secondary attack ratio of 6%. Clinical secondary attack ratios varied from 5% to 18% depending on case definitions. The laboratory-based or clinical secondary attack ratios did not significantly differ across the intervention arms. Adherence to interventions was variable. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The secondary attack ratios were lower than anticipated, and lower than reported in other countries, perhaps due to differing patterns of susceptibility, lack of significant antigenic drift in circulating influenza virus strains recently, and/or issues related to the symptomatic recruitment design. Lessons learnt from this pilot have informed changes for the main study in 2008. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00425893 HKClinicalTrials.com HKCTR-365.},

INTERVENTIONS: Household contacts were randomly assigned by household cluster to take 75 mg of oseltamivir (n = 493) or placebo (n = 462) once daily for 7 days within 48 hours of symptom onset in the IC. The ICs did not receive antiviral treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical influenza in contacts of influenza-positive ICs, confirmed in a laboratory by detection of virus shedding in nose and throat swabs or a 4-fold or greater increase in influenza-specific serum antibody titer between baseline and convalescent serum samples. RESULTS: In contacts of an influenza-positive IC, the overall protective efficacy of oseltamivir against clinical influenza was 89% for individuals (95% confidence interval [CI], 67%-97%; P<.001) and 84% for households (95% CI, 49%-95%; P<.001). In contacts of all ICs, oseltamivir also significantly reduced incidence of clinical influenza, with 89% protective efficacy (95% CI, 71%-96%; P<.001). Viral shedding was inhibited in contacts taking oseltamivir, with 84% protective efficacy (95% CI, 57%-95%; P<.001). All virus isolates from oseltamivir recipients retained sensitivity to the active metabolite. Oseltamivir was well tolerated; gastrointestinal tract effects were reported with similar frequency in oseltamivir (9.3%) and placebo (7.2%) recipients. CONCLUSION: In our sample, postexposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir, 75 mg once daily for 7 days, protected close contacts of influenza-infected persons against influenza illness, prevented outbreaks within households, and was well tolerated.},

title = {Mitigation strategies for pandemic influenza in the United States},
abstract = {Recent human deaths due to infection by highly pathogenic (H5N1) avian influenza A virus have raised the specter of a devastating pandemic like that of 1917-1918, should this avian virus evolve to become readily transmissible among humans. We introduce and use a large-scale stochastic simulation model to investigate the spread of a pandemic strain of influenza virus through the U.S. population of 281 million individuals for R(0) (the basic reproductive number) from 1.6 to 2.4. We model the impact that a variety of levels and combinations of influenza antiviral agents, vaccines, and modified social mobility (including school closure and travel restrictions) have on the timing and magnitude of this spread. Our simulations demonstrate that, in a highly mobile population, restricting travel after an outbreak is detected is likely to delay slightly the time course of the outbreak without impacting the eventual number ill. For R(0) < 1.9, our model suggests that the rapid production and distribution of vaccines, even if poorly matched to circulating strains, could significantly slow disease spread and limit the number ill to <10% of the population, particularly if children are preferentially vaccinated. Alternatively, the aggressive deployment of several million courses of influenza antiviral agents in a targeted prophylaxis strategy may contain a nascent outbreak with low R(0), provided adequate contact tracing and distribution capacities exist. For higher R(0), we predict that multiple strategies in combination (involving both social and medical interventions) will be required to achieve similar limits on illness rates.},

title = {Contact heterogeneity in deer mice: implications for Sin Nombre virus transmission},
abstract = {Heterogeneities within disease hosts suggest that not all individuals have the same probability of transmitting disease or becoming infected. This heterogeneity is thought to be due to dissimilarity in susceptibility and exposure among hosts. As such, it has been proposed that many host-pathogen systems follow the general pattern whereby a small fraction of the population accounts for a large fraction of the pathogen transmission. This disparity in transmission dynamics is often referred to as '20/80 Rule', i.e. approximately 20 per cent of the hosts are responsible for 80 per cent of pathogen transmission. We investigated the role of heterogeneity in contact rates among potential hosts of a directly transmitted pathogen by examining Sin Nombre virus (SNV) in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using foraging arenas and powder marking, we documented contacts between wild deer mice in Great Basin Desert, central Utah. Our findings demonstrated heterogeneity among deer mice, both in frequency and in duration of contacts with other deer mice. Contact dynamics appear to follow the general pattern that a minority of the population accounts for a majority of the contacts. We found that 20 per cent of individuals in the population were responsible for roughly 80 per cent of the contacts observed. Larger-bodied individuals appear to be the functional group with the greatest SNV transmission potential. Contrary to our predictions, transmission potential was not influenced by breeding condition or sex.},

title = {Origins of the new influenza A(H1N1) virus: time to take action},
abstract = {To gain insight into the possible origins of the 2009 outbreak of new influenza A(H1N1), we performed two independent analyses of genetic evolution of the new influenza A(H1N1) virus. Firstly, protein homology analyses of more than 400 sequences revealed that this virus most likely evolved from recent swine viruses. Secondly, phylogenetic analyses of 5,214 protein sequences of influenza A(H1N1) viruses (avian, swine and human) circulating in North America for the last two decades (from 1989 to 2009) indicated that the new influenza A(H1N1) virus possesses a distinctive evolutionary trait (genetic distinctness). This appears to be a particular characteristic in pig-human interspecies transmission of influenza A. Thus these analyses contribute to the evidence of the role of pig populations as "mixing vessels" for influenza A(H1N1) viruses.},

title = {Measuring exposure to S. japonicum in China. I. Activity diaries to assess water contact and comparison to other measures},
abstract = {We introduce a new method, activity diaries, in order to evaluate human water contact among fishing communities in an area moderately endemic for Schistosoma japonicum in the Dongting Lake region of Southern China. Two hundred and forty-nine subjects (76% male) were followed prospectively over a 9-month-period in order to verify exposure and reinfection. Exposure was determined crudely with questionnaires, direct 12-h water observations, and more precisely with activity diaries and an adjusted exposure model which took into account the time of day, the duration of contact and the percent body surface area in contact with water. Cohort subjects filled in activity diaries for an average of 85 days as compared with 2 days for the direct water observations. The typical unadjusted mean daily water contact (duration) based on the activity diaries was 53 min with 62% of this time spent in fishing. In contrast, the direct water observations revealed an average daily duration of 149 min with 53% of the time spent in fishing. Human water contact patterns (min/day) by site, activity and body part exposed were examined with the activity diaries. Individuals in the 36-49-year-old age range had the highest degree of water contact. Most of this daily contact occurred by males on the hands (mean+/-S.D.; 83.53+/-67.80 min/day) while fishing (mean+/-S.D.; 87.84+/-8.88 min/day) on the lake (mean+/-S.D.; 85.98+/-69.90 min/day). There was a strong positive log correlation (r=0.95) between the crude and adjusted (based on our derived exposure model) diary outcomes for the entire study sample, however, at higher exposure levels this relationship was differentially weaker (r=0.70). Results from this study suggest that current methods used in evaluating schistosomiasis exposure in China may overestimate and bias measures of the risk of infection. Activity diaries adjusted for the time of day, duration and the percent body surface area exposed are cost-effective and practical instruments to accurately quantify human exposure in the vast lake regions of Southern China where most of the endemic schistosomiasis japonica occurs.},

title = {Effectiveness of influenza vaccine in the community-dwelling elderly},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reliable estimates of the effectiveness of influenza vaccine among persons 65 years of age and older are important for informed vaccination policies and programs. Short-term studies may provide misleading pictures of long-term benefits, and residual confounding may have biased past results. This study examined the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in seniors over the long term while addressing potential bias and residual confounding in the results. METHODS: Data were pooled from 18 cohorts of community-dwelling elderly members of one U.S. health maintenance organization (HMO) for 1990-1991 through 1999-2000 and of two other HMOs for 1996-1997 through 1999-2000. Logistic regression was used to estimate the effectiveness of the vaccine for the prevention of hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza and death after adjustment for important covariates. Additional analyses explored for evidence of bias and the potential effect of residual confounding. RESULTS: There were 713,872 person-seasons of observation. Most high-risk medical conditions that were measured were more prevalent among vaccinated than among unvaccinated persons. Vaccination was associated with a 27% reduction in the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza (adjusted odds ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.77) and a 48% reduction in the risk of death (adjusted odds ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.55). Estimates were generally stable across age and risk subgroups. In the sensitivity analyses, we modeled the effect of a hypothetical unmeasured confounder that would have caused overestimation of vaccine effectiveness in the main analysis; vaccination was still associated with statistically significant--though lower--reductions in the risks of both hospitalization and death. CONCLUSIONS: During 10 seasons, influenza vaccination was associated with significant reductions in the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza and in the risk of death among community-dwelling elderly persons. Vaccine delivery to this high-priority group should be improved.},

abstract = {The relationship of acute respiratory illness and infection to chronic bronchitis was investigated in the community of Tecumseh, Michigan. Families were randomly selected for study from among all those in the community and they were followed for periods of one year. Occurrence of acute respiratory illnesses was identified on a weekly basis. Frequency of chronic symptoms of cough and sputum production was separately ascertained. Lung function studies were performed three times during the course of the surveillance year and blood specimens were collected at those times. The blood specimens were tested for rise in antibody titer with antigens of type A and B influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Adults with mild or intermittent chronic symptoms of cough and sputum production experienced more acute respiratory illness than those without these symptoms. This finding was present at different levels of smoking frequency. A similar relationship was present when serologic infection rates were used in the analysis instead of acute illness incidence. When the population was dichotomized on the basis of lung function data, the segment of the population with more depressed values was found to have experienced higher infection rates. The results suggest that acute infection may play an independent role in the pathogenesis of chronic respiratory disease.},

title = {Can influenza epidemics be prevented by voluntary vaccination?},
abstract = {Previous modeling studies have identified the vaccination coverage level necessary for preventing influenza epidemics, but have not shown whether this critical coverage can be reached. Here we use computational modeling to determine, for the first time, whether the critical coverage for influenza can be achieved by voluntary vaccination. We construct a novel individual-level model of human cognition and behavior; individuals are characterized by two biological attributes (memory and adaptability) that they use when making vaccination decisions. We couple this model with a population-level model of influenza that includes vaccination dynamics. The coupled models allow individual-level decisions to influence influenza epidemiology and, conversely, influenza epidemiology to influence individual-level decisions. By including the effects of adaptive decision-making within an epidemic model, we can reproduce two essential characteristics of influenza epidemiology: annual variation in epidemic severity and sporadic occurrence of severe epidemics. We suggest that individual-level adaptive decision-making may be an important (previously overlooked) causal factor in driving influenza epidemiology. We find that severe epidemics cannot be prevented unless vaccination programs offer incentives. Frequency of severe epidemics could be reduced if programs provide, as an incentive to be vaccinated, several years of free vaccines to individuals who pay for one year of vaccination. Magnitude of epidemic amelioration will be determined by the number of years of free vaccination, an individuals' adaptability in decision-making, and their memory. This type of incentive program could control epidemics if individuals are very adaptable and have long-term memories. However, incentive-based programs that provide free vaccination for families could increase the frequency of severe epidemics. We conclude that incentive-based vaccination programs are necessary to control influenza, but some may be detrimental. Surprisingly, we find that individuals' memories and flexibility in adaptive decision-making can be extremely important factors in determining the success of influenza vaccination programs. Finally, we discuss the implication of our results for controlling pandemics.},

We show that increasing the degree of cooperativity induces a qualitative transition from a segregated phase of low utility toward a mixed phase of high utility. By introducing a simple function that links the individual and global levels, we pave the way to a rigorous approach of a wide class of systems, where dynamics are governed by individual strategies.},

title = {Prevention of nosocomial transmission of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in rural South African district hospitals: an epidemiological modelling study},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis has spread among hospitalised patients in South Africa, but the epidemic-level effect of hospital-based infection control strategies remains unknown. We modelled the plausible effect of rapidly available infection control strategies on the overall course of the XDR tuberculosis epidemic in a rural area of South Africa. METHODS: We investigated the effect of administrative, environmental, and personal infection control measures on the epidemic trajectory of XDR tuberculosis in the rural community of Tugela Ferry. Assessments were done with a mathematical model incorporating over 2 years of longitudinal inpatient and community-based data. The model simulated inpatient airborne tuberculosis transmission, community tuberculosis transmission, and the effect of HIV and antiretroviral therapy. FINDINGS: If no new interventions are introduced, about 1300 cases of XDR tuberculosis are predicted to occur in the area of Tugela Ferry by the end of 2012, more than half of which are likely to be nosocomially transmitted. Mask use alone would avert fewer than 10% of cases in the overall epidemic, but could prevent a large proportion of cases of XDR tuberculosis in hospital staff. The combination of mask use with reduced hospitalisation time and a shift to outpatient therapy could prevent nearly a third of XDR tuberculosis cases. Supplementing this approach with improved ventilation, rapid drug resistance testing, HIV treatment, and tuberculosis isolation facilities could avert 48% of XDR tuberculosis cases (range 34-50%) by the end of 2012. However, involuntary detention could result in an unexpected rise in incidence due to restricted isolation capacity. INTERPRETATION: A synergistic combination of available nosocomial infection control strategies could prevent nearly half of XDR tuberculosis cases, even in a resource-limited setting. XDR tuberculosis transmission will probably continue in the community, indicating the need to develop and implement parallel community-based programmes.},

abstract = {Many countries plan to close schools during a future influenza pandemic, although the potential impact is poorly understood. We apply a model of the transmission dynamics of pandemic influenza to consultation, serological and clinical data from the United Kingdom from the 1957 (Asian) influenza pandemic, to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0), the proportion of infected individuals who experience clinical symptoms and the impact of school/nursery closures. The R0 for Asian influenza was about 1.8 and 60-65% of infected individuals were estimated to have experienced clinical symptoms. During a future pandemic, closure of schools/nurseries could reduce the epidemic size only by a very small amount (<10%) if R0 is high (e.g. 2.5 or 3.5), and modest reductions, e.g. 22% might be possible if it is low (1.8) and schools are closed early, depending on assumptions about contact patterns. Further data on contact patterns and their dependence on school closures are needed.},

abstract = {This report provides recommendations by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding the use of vaccine against infection with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus. Information on vaccination for seasonal influenza has been published previously (CDC. Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP], 2009. MMWR 2009;58[No. RR-8]). Vaccines against novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection have not yet been licensed; however, licensed vaccine is expected to be available by mid-October 2009. On July 29, 2009, ACIP reviewed epidemiologic and clinical data to determine which population groups should be targeted initially for vaccination. ACIP also considered the projected vaccine supply likely to be available when vaccine is first available and the expected increase in vaccine availability during the following 6 months. These recommendations are intended to provide vaccination programs and providers with information to assist in planning and to alert providers and the public about target groups comprising an estimated 159 million persons who are recommended to be first to receive influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. The guiding principle of these recommendations is to vaccinate as many persons as possible as quickly as possible. Vaccination efforts should begin as soon as vaccine is available. State and local health officials and vaccination providers should make decisions about vaccine administration and distribution in accordance with state and local conditions. Highlights of these recommendations include 1) the identification of five initial target groups for vaccination efforts (pregnant women, persons who live with or provide care for infants aged <6 months, health-care and emergency medical services personnel, children and young adults aged 6 months-24 years, and persons aged 25-64 years who have medical conditions that put them at higher risk for influenza-related complications), 2) establishment of priority for a subset of persons within the initial target groups in the event that initial vaccine availability is unable to meet demand, and 3) guidance on use of vaccine in other adult population groups as vaccine availability increases. Vaccination and health-care providers should be alert to announcements and additional information from state and local health departments and CDC concerning vaccination against novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. Additional information is available from state and local health departments and from CDC's influenza website (http://www.cdc.gov/flu).},

This scientific statement discusses the potential cardiovascular complications of exercise, their pathological substrate, and their incidence and suggests strategies to reduce these complications. Exercise-associated acute cardiac events generally occur in individuals with structural cardiac disease. Hereditary or congenital cardiovascular abnormalities are predominantly responsible for cardiac events among young individuals, whereas atherosclerotic disease is primarily responsible for these events in adults. The absolute rate of exercise-related sudden cardiac death varies with the prevalence of disease in the study population. The incidence of both acute myocardial infarction and sudden death is greatest in the habitually least physically active individuals. No strategies have been adequately studied to evaluate their ability to reduce exercise-related acute cardiovascular events. Maintaining physical fitness through regular physical activity may help to reduce events because a disproportionate number of events occur in least physically active subjects performing unaccustomed physical activity. Other strategies, such as screening patients before participation in exercise, excluding high-risk patients from certain activities, promptly evaluating possible prodromal symptoms, training fitness personnel for emergencies, and encouraging patients to avoid high-risk activities, appear prudent but have not been systematically evaluated.},

title = {Mapping H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza risk in Southeast Asia},
abstract = {The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus that emerged in southern China in the mid-1990s has in recent years evolved into the first HPAI panzootic. In many countries where the virus was detected, the virus was successfully controlled, whereas other countries face periodic reoccurrence despite significant control efforts. A central question is to understand the factors favoring the continuing reoccurrence of the virus. The abundance of domestic ducks, in particular free-grazing ducks feeding in intensive rice cropping areas, has been identified as one such risk factor based on separate studies carried out in Thailand and Vietnam. In addition, recent extensive progress was made in the spatial prediction of rice cropping intensity obtained through satellite imagery processing. This article analyses the statistical association between the recorded HPAI H5N1 virus presence and a set of five key environmental variables comprising elevation, human population, chicken numbers, duck numbers, and rice cropping intensity for three synchronous epidemic waves in Thailand and Vietnam. A consistent pattern emerges suggesting risk to be associated with duck abundance, human population, and rice cropping intensity in contrast to a relatively low association with chicken numbers. A statistical risk model based on the second epidemic wave data in Thailand is found to maintain its predictive power when extrapolated to Vietnam, which supports its application to other countries with similar agro-ecological conditions such as Laos or Cambodia. The model's potential application to mapping HPAI H5N1 disease risk in Indonesia is discussed.},

In designing a study to evaluate vaccination, the type of effect and the question of interest determine the appropriate choice of comparison population and parameter. Possible questions of interest include that of the biologic effect of vaccination on susceptibility, on infectiousness, or on progression to disease in individuals. The indirect effects, total effects, and overall public health benefits of widespread vaccination of individuals within the context of a vaccination program might also be of primary concern. The change in behavior induced by belief in the protective effects of vaccination might influence the estimates of these effects or might itself be of interest. In this paper, the authors present a framework of study designs that relates the scientific question of interest to the choice of comparison groups, the unit of observation, the level of information available for analysis, and the parameter of effect.},

title = {Averting epidemics of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis},
abstract = {Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) has been detected in most provinces of South Africa, particularly in the KwaZulu-Natal province where several hundred cases have been reported since 2004. We analyzed the transmission dynamics of XDR TB in the region using mathematical models, and observed that nosocomial transmission clusters of XDR TB may emerge into community-based epidemics under the public health conditions of many South African communities. The effective reproductive number of XDR TB in KwaZulu-Natal may be around 2. Intensified community-based case finding and therapy appears critical to curtailing transmission. In the setting of delayed disease presentation and high system demand, improved diagnostic approaches may need to be employed in community-based programs rather than exclusively at tertiary hospitals. Using branching process mathematics, we observed that early, community-based drug-susceptibility testing and effective XDR therapy could help curtail ongoing transmission and reduce the probability of XDR TB epidemics in neighboring territories.},

We present analyses of data on key parameters and distributions and discuss the processes of data capture, analysis and public health policy formulation during the SARS epidemic are discussed. The low transmissibility of the virus, combined with the onset of peak infectiousness following the onset of clinical symptoms of disease, transpired to make simple public health measures, such as isolating patients and quarantining their contacts, very effective in the control of the SARS epidemic. We conclude that we were lucky this time round, but may not be so with the next epidemic outbreak of a novel aetiological agent. We present analyses that help to further understanding of what intervention measures are likely to work best with infectious agents of defined biological and epidemiological properties. These lessons learnt from the SARS experience are presented in an epidemiological and public health context.},

title = {Predicting undetected infections during the 2007 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak},
abstract = {Active disease surveillance during epidemics is of utmost importance in detecting and eliminating new cases quickly, and targeting such surveillance to high-risk individuals is considered more efficient than applying a random strategy. Contact tracing has been used as a form of at-risk targeting, and a variety of mathematical models have indicated that it is likely to be highly efficient. However, for fast-moving epidemics, resource constraints limit the ability of the authorities to perform, and follow up, contact tracing effectively. As an alternative, we present a novel real-time Bayesian statistical methodology to determine currently undetected (occult) infections. For the UK foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic of 2007, we use real-time epidemic data synthesized with previous knowledge of FMD outbreaks in the UK to predict which premises might have been infected, but remained undetected, at any point during the outbreak. This provides both a framework for targeting surveillance in the face of limited resources and an indicator of the current severity and spatial extent of the epidemic. We anticipate that this methodology will be of substantial benefit in future outbreaks, providing a compromise between targeted manual surveillance and random or spatially targeted strategies.},

abstract = {A mouse bioassay was used monthly over the infection season of 2001 to determine the temporal and spatial variability of schistosome cercarial density in irrigation ditches in five villages in southwestern Sichuan Province in the People's Republic of China. Analysis of variance showed that approximately half of the variability was due to the village and site within the village, with little contribution from air temperature, weekly average rainfall, or the month within the infection season in which the bioassay was performed. The location-specific variability in these data suggest that epidemiologic studies will generally have low power to detect the influence of water-contact intensity on human parasite burden without taking account of variations in cercarial density at sites of water contact.},

abstract = {In stark contrast to the huge body of theoretical work on the importance of hosts and parasites as selective agents acting on each other, until recently, little systematic empirical investigation of this issue has been attempted. Research on snail-schistosome interactions have, therefore, the potential for making an important contribution to the study of coevolution or reciprocal adaptation. This may be particularly pertinent since snail-schistosomes represent an indirectly transmitted macroparasite system, so often overlooked amongst both theoretical and empirical studies. Here we review ideas and experiments on snail-schistosome interactions, with particular emphasis on those that may have relevance to the potential coevolution between host resistance and parasite infectivity and virulence. We commence with an introduction and definition of the general concepts, before going into detail of some specific studies to illustrate these: evidence of snail-schistosome coevolutionary process in the field; evidence of coevolutionary processes in the laboratory; a general assessment of the applicability of coevolutionary models in snail-schistosome interactions; and finishing with a section on conclusions and areas for further study.},

abstract = {A statistical method is presented for determining acquisition rates of illness from community sources of infection and for distinguishing among viruses which are associated with different epidemic seasons. The new method consists of a computationally simple procedure for estimating the community transmission parameter and the standard error of the estimator. This method, as well as a previously developed maximum likelihood procedure, is applied to illness data as a means for distinguishing among broad patterns of illness acquisition. The periods evaluated are the rhinovirus, influenza A and influenza B seasons in Tecumseh, Michigan, for the years 1976-1980. Tecumseh households are stratified into exposure groups depending on age-group composition. Estimates are found for the risk differences of illness acquired from the community for households with different age-group distributions. Analysis of the Tecumseh data reveals that members of households with children are more apt than members of households without children to acquire illness associated with rhinovirus, influenza A and influenza B from the community. Members of households with just preschool children (and adults) are more apt than members of households with just school children (and adults) to acquire illness associated with rhinovirus and influenza B from the community. In contrast, members of households with just preschool children (and adults) are just as likely as members of households with just school children (and adults) to acquire illnesses associated with influenza A from the community.},

For effective control, it is imperative that the full host spectrum of this infection is understood. Although about 46 species of mammals are known to carry natural infection with S. japonicum, only a few might be of potential threat to human infection. Generally, in an endemic area, transmission of schistosomiasis to human depends largely on the availability and abundance of permissive hosts. Another important factor that needs to be taken into consideration in developing control measures against S. japonicum is potential strain differences. This review collates pertinent host-parasite relationship of S. japonicum in mammals in an endemic area and assesses the epidemiological significance of these findings for human infection.},

abstract = {"The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure" provides a new guideline for hypertension prevention and management. The following are the key messages(1) In persons older than 50 years, systolic blood pressure (BP) of more than 140 mm Hg is a much more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; (2) The risk of CVD, beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, doubles with each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; individuals who are normotensive at 55 years of age have a 90% lifetime risk for developing hypertension; (3) Individuals with a systolic BP of 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic BP of 80 to 89 mm Hg should be considered as prehypertensive and require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent CVD; (4) Thiazide-type diuretics should be used in drug treatment for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes. Certain high-risk conditions are compelling indications for the initial use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); (5) Most patients with hypertension will require 2 or more antihypertensive medications to achieve goal BP (<140/90 mm Hg, or <130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease); (6) If BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above goal BP, consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 2 agents, 1 of which usually should be a thiazide-type diuretic; and (7) The most effective therapy prescribed by the most careful clinician will control hypertension only if patients are motivated. Motivation improves when patients have positive experiences with and trust in the clinician. Empathy builds trust and is a potent motivator. Finally, in presenting these guidelines, the committee recognizes that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.},

abstract = {Children aged <5 years or with certain chronic medical conditions are at increased risk for complications and death from influenza. Because of this increased risk, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has prioritized influenza prevention and treatment for children aged <5 years and for those with certain chronic medical and immunosuppressive conditions. CDC monitors child influenza deaths through its influenza-associated pediatric mortality reporting system. As of August 8, 2009, CDC had received reports of 477 deaths associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in the United States, including 36 deaths among children aged <18 years. To characterize these cases, CDC analyzed data from April to August 2009. The results of that analysis indicated that, of 36 children who died, seven (19%) were aged <5 years, and 24 (67%) had one or more of the high-risk medical conditions. Twenty-two (92%) of the 24 children with high-risk medical conditions had neurodevelopmental conditions. Among 23 children with culture or pathology results reported, laboratory-confirmed bacterial coinfections were identified in 10 (43%), including all six children who 1) were aged >or=5 years, 2) had no recognized high-risk condition, and 3) had culture or pathology results reported. Early diagnosis of influenza can enable prompt initiation of antiviral therapy for children who are at greater risk or severely ill. Clinicians also should be aware of the potential for severe bacterial coinfections among children diagnosed with influenza and treat accordingly. All children aged >or=6 months and caregivers of children aged <6 months should receive influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine when available.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, 112 million people are infected with Schistosoma haematobium, with the most intense infections in children 5-15 years old. METHODS: We describe a longitudinal epidemiological study that evaluates the relationship between S. haematobium infection and associated morbidity in children before and after the large-scale administration of praziquantel for schistosomiasis and albendazole for soil-transmitted helminths. RESULTS: At baseline, higher intensities of S. haematobium infection were observed in children with anemia and/or severe microhematuria, but there was no apparent association between the risk of undernutrition and intensity of S. haematobium infection. Significant reductions in the prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium infection 1 year after treatment were, however, observed. Children who benefited the most from anthelmintic treatment in terms of increased hemoglobin concentrations were those who had anemia at baseline and those with highly positive microhematuria scores at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that even a single round of mass chemotherapy can have a substantial impact on S. haematobium infection and its associated morbidity in children.},

Best available census counts were distributed to cells based on probability coefficients which, in turn, were based on road proximity, slope, land cover, and nighttime lights. LandScan 1998 has been completed for the entire world. Verification and validation (V{\&}V) studies were conducted routinely for all regions and more extensively for Israel, Germany, and the southwestern United States. Geographic information systems (GIS) were essential for conflation of diverse input variables, computation of probability coefficients, allocation of population to cells, and reconciliation of cell totals with aggregate (usually province) control totals. Remote sensing was an essential source of two input variables-land cover and nightime lights-and one ancillary database-high -resolution panchromatic imagery-used in V{\&}V of the population model and resulting LandScan database.},

title = {Measuring exposure to Schistosoma japonicum in China. III. Activity diaries, snail and human infection, transmission ecology and options for control},
abstract = {We used activity diaries and snail detection to relate water contact and Schistosoma japonicum infection among a cohort of 178 residents on two islands in the Dongting Lake, China. Water exposure to each of 12 mapped water zones around the islands was calculated (m(2) min/day) for each subject. Infected Oncomelania hupensis hupensis snails in this area are focal and were found in only five of the 12 zones, with the highest rate being 5.7%. Thirty-one subjects (17%) were re-infected with a mean intensity of 63.2 epg. Mean water contact was 7.9 m(2) min/day; 98% of water exposure was due to economic activity and only 2% due to swimming or bathing, washing and other necessities of daily life. Males had more exposure and infection than females (P<0.05). Infected subjects had more exposure (10.2 m(2) min/day) than those not infected (7.44 m(2) min/day) (P<0.05). Compared with uninfected subjects, those infected had 2.9 times more exposure in infected-snail zones (P<0.01). Also, human infection intensity (epg) correlated well with exposure to infected snail zones (r=0.552, P<0.01). People <20 years old had the highest re-infection (21.4%) and intensity (3.77 epg). Median exposure for 20-49-year-olds (9.00 m(2) min/day) was nearly double that of those aged <20 or >50 years old (5.5 m(2) min/day). We conclude that map-referenced water contact and snail evaluation boosts accuracy of activity-diary measurements in large transmission foci for the Asian schistosome. Protecting against faecal contamination of snail inhabited sites, and against occupational exposure for island residents, should be a priority of future research. Potential strategies for migrating buffaloes and families living on visiting fishing boats are explored.},

title = {Influenza outbreak during Sydney World Youth Day 2008: the utility of laboratory testing and case definitions on mass gathering outbreak containment},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza causes annual epidemics and often results in extensive outbreaks in closed communities. To minimize transmission, a range of interventions have been suggested. For these to be effective, an accurate and timely diagnosis of influenza is required. This is confirmed by a positive laboratory test result in an individual whose symptoms are consistent with a predefined clinical case definition. However, the utility of these clinical case definitions and laboratory testing in mass gathering outbreaks remains unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: An influenza outbreak was identified during World Youth Day 2008 in Sydney. From the data collected on pilgrims presenting to a single clinic, a Markov model was developed and validated against the actual epidemic curve. Simulations were performed to examine the utility of different clinical case definitions and laboratory testing strategies for containment of influenza outbreaks. Clinical case definitions were found to have the greatest impact on averting further cases with no added benefit when combined with any laboratory test. Although nucleic acid testing (NAT) demonstrated higher utility than indirect immunofluorescence antigen or on-site point-of-care testing, this effect was lost when laboratory NAT turnaround times was included. The main benefit of laboratory confirmation was limited to identification of true influenza cases amenable to interventions such as antiviral therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous re-evaluation of case definitions and laboratory testing strategies are essential for effective management of influenza outbreaks during mass gatherings.},

title = {Methods for monitoring influenza surveillance data},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A variety of Serfling-type statistical algorithms requiring long series of historical data, exclusively from temperate climate zones, have been proposed for automated monitoring of influenza sentinel surveillance data. We evaluated three alternative statistical approaches where alert thresholds are based on recent data in both temperate and subtropical regions. METHODS: We compared time series, regression, and cumulative sum (CUSUM) models on empirical data from Hong Kong and the US using a composite index (range = 0-1) consisting of the key outcomes of sensitivity, specificity, and time to detection (lag). The index was calculated based on alarms generated within the first 2 or 4 weeks of the peak season. RESULTS: We found that the time series model was optimal in the Hong Kong setting, while both the time series and CUSUM models worked equally well on US data. For alarms generated within the first 2 weeks (4 weeks) of the peak season in Hong Kong, the maximum values of the index were: time series 0.77 (0.86); regression 0.75 (0.82); CUSUM 0.56 (0.75). In the US data the maximum values of the index were: time series 0.81 (0.95); regression 0.81 (0.91); CUSUM 0.90 (0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Automated influenza surveillance methods based on short-term data, including time series and CUSUM models, can generate sensitive, specific, and timely alerts, and can offer a useful alternative to Serfling-like methods that rely on long-term, historically based thresholds.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A novel influenza A virus, subtype H1N1 of swine-lineage (H1N1 swl) has transmitted rapidly to many regions of the world with evidence of sustained transmission within some countries. Rapid detection and differentiation from seasonal influenza is essential to instigate appropriate patient and public health management and for disease surveillance. OBJECTIVES: To develop a rapid and sensitive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) for confirmation of H1N1 swl. STUDY DESIGN: A one-step rtRT-PCR approach was employed to target the matrix gene of the novel influenza A/H1N1 swl and validated against a panel of seasonal influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), swine influenza A/H1N1 and avian influenza A/H5N1 viruses. The assay following validation was then used prospectively to detect H1N1 swl positive specimens from the recent outbreaks in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. RESULTS: The one-step H1N1 swl matrix rtRT-PCR successfully detected H1N1 swl clinical specimens and did not cross-react with seasonal influenza A, subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and swine influenza A (H1N1). The H1N1 swl matrix assay did cross react with H5N1. The H1N1 swl matrix assay was then compared to two other assays using a dilution series and a panel of untyped influenza A positive clinical samples. These experiments found the assay to have a comparable sensitivity to the established universal influenza A rtRT-PCR and was more sensitive than the H1N1 swl specific assay that targeted the H1 region. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the rtRT-PCR is sensitive and should be used alongside existing universal influenza A assays to rapidly detect the novel H1N1 swl virus.},

title = {Optimal reactive vaccination strategies for a foot-and-mouth outbreak in the UK},
abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the UK provides an ideal opportunity to explore optimal control measures for an infectious disease. The presence of fine-scale spatio-temporal data for the 2001 epidemic has allowed the development of epidemiological models that are more accurate than those generally created for other epidemics and provide the opportunity to explore a variety of alternative control measures. Vaccination was not used during the 2001 epidemic; however, the recent DEFRA (Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs) contingency plan details how reactive vaccination would be considered in future. Here, using the data from the 2001 epidemic, we consider the optimal deployment of limited vaccination capacity in a complex heterogeneous environment. We use a model of FMD spread to investigate the optimal deployment of reactive ring vaccination of cattle constrained by logistical resources. The predicted optimal ring size is highly dependent upon logistical constraints but is more robust to epidemiological parameters. Other ways of targeting reactive vaccination can significantly reduce the epidemic size; in particular, ignoring the order in which infections are reported and vaccinating those farms closest to any previously reported case can substantially reduce the epidemic. This strategy has the advantage that it rapidly targets new foci of infection and that determining an optimal ring size is unnecessary.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of influenza vaccine over multiple influenza seasons in children less than 5 years of age has not been well studied. This is especially important to assess because of the recent recommendation for routine influenza vaccination in childhood. We conducted a matched case-control study to assess the vaccine effectiveness of Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (TIV) against laboratory-confirmed, medically attended influenza among children 6-59 months of age at the start of each influenza season from 1999-2000 through 2006-2007 in Olmsted County, MN, USA. The children vaccinated against influenza accordingly to the 2007 ACIP guidelines had a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed medically attended influenza illness (Odds Ratio: 0.14, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.03-0.71) than the unvaccinated children. TIV provided strong protection against laboratory-confirmed medically attended influenza in children 6-59 months old in the fully vaccinated group. This trend continued in the partially vaccinated group (Odds Ratio: 0.27, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.07-0.97) but the protection provided maybe suboptimal.},

title = {Racial differences in incident heart failure among young adults},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The antecedents and epidemiology of heart failure in young adults are poorly understood. METHODS: We prospectively assessed the incidence of heart failure over a 20-year period among 5115 blacks and whites of both sexes who were 18 to 30 years of age at baseline. Using Cox models, we examined predictors of hospitalization or death from heart failure. RESULTS: Over the course of 20 years, heart failure developed in 27 participants (mean [+/-SD] age at onset, 39+/-6 years), all but 1 of whom were black. The cumulative incidence of heart failure before the age of 50 years was 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 1.7) in black women, 0.9% (95% CI, 0.5 to 1.4) in black men, 0.08% (95% CI, 0.0 to 0.5) in white women, and 0% (95% CI, 0 to 0.4) in white men (P=0.001 for the comparison of black participants and white participants). Among blacks, independent predictors at 18 to 30 years of age of heart failure occurring 15 years, on average, later included higher diastolic blood pressure (hazard ratio per 10.0 mm Hg, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.1), higher body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) (hazard ratio per 5.7 units, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.9), lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hazard ratio per 13.3 mg per deciliter [0.34 mmol per liter], 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4 to 1.0), and kidney disease (hazard ratio, 19.8; 95% CI, 4.5 to 87.2). Three quarters of those in whom heart failure subsequently developed had hypertension by the time they were 40 years of age. Depressed systolic function, as assessed on a study echocardiogram when the participants were 23 to 35 years of age, was independently associated with the development of heart failure 10 years, on average, later (hazard ratio for abnormal systolic function, 36.9; 95% CI, 6.9 to 198.3; hazard ratio for borderline systolic function, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 10.2). Myocardial infarction, drug use, and alcohol use were not associated with the risk of heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Incident heart failure before 50 years of age is substantially more common among blacks than among whites. Hypertension, obesity, and systolic dysfunction that are present before a person is 35 years of age are important antecedents that may be targets for the prevention of heart failure.

title = {Reemerging H5N1 influenza viruses in Hong Kong in 2002 are highly pathogenic to ducks},
abstract = {Waterfowl are the natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses, which are usually nonpathogenic in wild aquatic birds. However, in late 2002, outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus caused deaths among wild migratory birds and resident waterfowl, including ducks, in two Hong Kong parks. In February 2003, an avian H5N1 virus closely related to one of these viruses was isolated from two humans with acute respiratory distress, one of whom died. Antigenic analysis of the new avian isolates showed a reactivity pattern different from that of H5N1 viruses isolated in 1997 and 2001. This finding suggests that significant antigenic variation has recently occurred among H5N1 viruses. We inoculated mallards with antigenically different H5N1 influenza viruses isolated between 1997 and 2003. The new 2002 avian isolates caused systemic infection in the ducks, with high virus titers and pathology in multiple organs, particularly the brain. Ducks developed acute disease, including severe neurological dysfunction and death. Virus was also isolated at high titers from the birds' drinking water and from contact birds, demonstrating efficient transmission. In contrast, H5N1 isolates from 1997 and 2001 were not consistently transmitted efficiently among ducks and did not cause significant disease. Despite a high level of genomic homology, the human isolate showed striking biological differences from its avian homologue in a duck model. This is the first reported case of lethal influenza virus infection in wild aquatic birds since 1961.},

As of April 28, the total number of confirmed S-OIV cases in the United States was 64; these cases occurred in California (10 cases), Kansas (two), New York (45), Ohio (one), and Texas (six). The viruses contain a unique combination of gene segments that had not been reported previously among swine or human influenza viruses in the United States or elsewhere. Viruses from 13 (20%) of 64 patients have been tested for resistance to antiviral medications. To date, all tested viruses are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine but are susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir. The purpose of this report is to provide detailed information on the drug susceptibility of the newly detected S-OIVs, which will aid in making recommendations for treatment and prophylaxis for swine influenza A (H1N1) infection. These data also will contribute to antiviral-resistance monitoring and diagnostic test development.},

abstract = {A recently emerged novel influenza A H1N1 virus continues to spread globally. The virus contains a novel constellation of gene segments, the nearest known precursors being viruses found in swine and it likely arose through reassortment of two or more viruses of swine origin. H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 subtype swine influenza viruses have occasionally infected humans before but such zoonotic transmission events did not lead to sustained human-to-human transmission in the manner this swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) has done. Its transmission among humans appears to be higher than that observed with seasonal influenza. Children and young adults appear to those most affected and also those who appear to maintain transmission. Clinical disease generally appears mild but complications leading to hospitalization can occur, especially in those with underlying lung or cardiac disease, diabetes or those on immunosuppresive therapies. There are concerns that the virus may reassort with existing human influenza virus giving rise to more transmissible or more pathogenic viruses. The virus appears to retain the potential to transmit back to swine and thus continued reassortment with swine viruses is a cause for concern.},

abstract = {Drug discovery is the main flag ship of the pharmaceutical industry in order to ensure that innovations constantly occur in the identification and development of novel therapeutic options for the management of diseases. Recently, research trends that take advantage of the safety and efficacy of marketed products by combining such products with other agents to influence certain clinical pharmacology attribute(s) have emerged. The focus of the review is to evaluate ongoing research trends that have considered leveraging on certain clinical pharmacology attributes in the areas of viral infection (HIV and influenza) and oncology. Case studies discussed in this review include: a) the use of probenecid to block the organic anion renal transport of oseltamivir carboxylate (a key active metabolite of oseltamivir phosphate) to reduce the oral dose of oseltamivir phosphate; b) the use of rifampicin to induce the CYP2C19 enzyme and thereby, promote the formation of a potent active metabolite M8 (nelfinavir hydroxyl-t-butylamide) and achieve sustained blood levels to combat HIV infection along with ritonavir; c) the use of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, cyclosporin A, ritonavir etc to overcome the extensive presystemic metabolism of docetaxel and enhance the oral bioavailability of docetaxel. Along with the case studies, several hurdles for drug development such as dose selection, frequency of dosing, and duration of the clinical studies, picking the right surrogate(s) for efficacy, evaluation of drug-drug interaction potential with other co-substrates have been discussed in line with the current day requirements for a sound clinical and regulatory strategy. In summary, based on the collated information, a pragmatic approach would render feasibility for a balanced therapy management using combined clinical pharmacology attributes of drugs.},

title = {Episodic outbreaks bias estimates of age-specific force of infection: a corrected method using measles as an example},
abstract = {Understanding age-specific differences in infection rates can be important in predicting the magnitude of and mortality in outbreaks and targeting age groups for vaccination programmes. Standard methods to estimate age-specific rates assume that the age-specific force of infection is constant in time. However, this assumption may easily be violated in the face of a highly variable outbreak history, as recently observed for acute immunizing infections like measles, in strongly seasonal settings. Here we investigate the biases that result from ignoring such fluctuations in incidence and present a correction based on the epidemic history. We apply the method to data from a measles outbreak in Niamey, Niger and show that, despite a bimodal age distribution of cases, the estimated age-specific force of infection is unimodal and concentrated in young children (<5 years) consistent with previous analyses of age-specific rates in the region.},

Surviving patients had rapid declines in the viral load to undetectable levels during treatment.

abstract = {We present an analysis of the current foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in Great Britain over the first 2 months of the spread of the virus. The net transmission potential of the pathogen and the increasing impact of control measures are estimated over the course of the epidemic to date. These results are used to parameterize a mathematical model of disease transmission that captures the differing spatial contact patterns between farms before and after the imposition of movement restrictions. The model is used to make predictions of future incidence and to simulate the impact of additional control strategies. Hastening the slaughter of animals with suspected infection is predicted to slow the epidemic, but more drastic action, such as "ring" culling or vaccination around infection foci, is necessary for more rapid control. Culling is predicted to be more effective than vaccination.},

title = {Estimating the distribution of worm burden and egg excretion of Schistosoma japonicum by risk group in Sichuan Province, China},
abstract = {During autumn 2000 an extensive cross-sectional survey of the prevalence of Schistosomiasis japonicum was conducted among about 4000 villagers within 20 villages in the Anning River Valley located in the southwestern Sichuan Province. Two procedures were used to assess infection status, the Kato-Katz thick smear procedure and a miracidia hatch test. Whereas the Kato-Katz procedure provides information on both prevalence and intensity, the hatch test provides only prevalence data, albeit on a much larger volume of stool. In addition, we performed Kato-Katz smears for 15 consecutive samples on a subset of 15 individuals. The proportion of both hatch-test and Kato-Katz positive individuals in the larger cross-sectional survey was 25%. The goal of the study was to estimate both the egg and worm distributions among risk groups using both the hatch and Kato-Katz tests from the cross-sectional data and the repeated Kato-Katz smears from the longitudinal data sets. As a prelude to parameter estimation, individuals were classified into risk groups by natural village and occupation; the proportion of Kato-Katz positive subjects among the risk groups varied from 10% to 60%. We used the statistical model of de Vlas et al. (1992) and Bayesian techniques to derive both estimates of and inference about the worm and egg distribution parameters. The parameter estimates imply (1) similar eggs per gram stool (e.p.g.) per worm pair compared with earlier estimates, (2) a range of worm burdens among the risk groups and (3) estimates of risk heterogeneity within groups is sensitive to prior information on the within-person variability in egg excretion.},

title = {Safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated subvirion influenza A (H5N1) vaccine},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza A (H5N1) viruses could cause a severe worldwide epidemic, with high attack rates, large numbers of deaths and hospitalizations, and wide disruption. Effective vaccines against these viruses in humans are urgently needed. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind two-stage study involving 451 healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age who were randomly assigned in a 2:2:2:2:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular doses of a subvirion influenza A (H5N1) vaccine of 90, 45, 15, or 7.5 microg of hemagglutinin antigen or placebo. The subjects were followed for the safety analysis for 56 days. Serum samples obtained before each vaccination and again 28 days after the second vaccination were tested for H5 antibody by microneutralization and hemagglutination inhibition. RESULTS: Mild pain at the injection site was the most common adverse event for all doses of vaccine. The frequency of a serum antibody response was highest among subjects receiving doses of 45 microg or 90 microg. Among those who received two doses of 90 microg, neutralization antibody titers reached 1:40 or greater in 54 percent, and hemagglutination-inhibition titers reached 1:40 or greater in 58 percent. Neutralization titers of 1:40 or greater were seen in 43 percent, 22 percent, and 9 percent of the subjects receiving two doses of 45, 15, and 7.5 microg, respectively. No responses were seen in placebo recipients. CONCLUSIONS: A two-dose regimen of 90 mug of subvirion influenza A (H5N1) vaccine does not cause severe side effects and, in the majority of recipients, generates neutralizing antibody responses typically associated with protection against influenza. A conventional subvirion H5 influenza vaccine may be effective in preventing influenza A (H5N1) disease in humans. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00115986.).},

abstract = {A broad range of studies of preventive measures in infectious diseases gives rise to incidence data from close contact groups. Parameters of common interest in such studies include transmission probabilities and efficacies of preventive or therapeutic interventions. We estimate these parameters using discrete-time likelihood models. We augment the data with unobserved pairwise transmission outcomes and fit the model using the EM algorithm. A linear model derived from the likelihood based on the augmented data and fitted with the iteratively re-weighted least squares method is also discussed. Using simulations, we demonstrate the comparable accuracy and lower sensitivity to initial estimates of the proposed methods with data augmentation relative to the likelihood model based solely on the observed data. Two randomized household-based trials of zanamivir, an influenza antiviral agent, are analyzed using the proposed methods.},

abstract = {An epidemiological method, field-tested in Hunan, China, to identify residents potentially susceptible or insusceptible to endemic schistosomiasis japonica is described, as a prelude to selection of subjects for immunogenetic studies. After an initial cross-sectional survey on two islands (Qingshan and Niangashan--population 2990) in 1995-1996, an informative cohort (N = 249) was selected for treatment and 9-month follow-up to measure exposure and re-infection. Both the population prevalence (15.8%) and the geometric mean intensity of infection (26.2 eggs/g faces) indicated that the islands were moderately endemic for schistosomiasis. Exposure measurements revealed a strong, positive, linear association (r = 0.70) between daily activity diaries and direct water-contact observation. Individuals identified as stool-positive for schistosomiasis had significantly more water contact than those who were egg-negative (P = 0.03). Almost all (93%) of the cohort had ultrasonographic evidence of periportal fibrosis before treatment but in only 1.2% was this fibrosis scored > 1 in terms of the stages identified by the World Health Organization. At the follow-up it was possible to classify the 249 subjects into three, distinct, exposure-infection epidemiological groups. The first group (N = 20) was susceptible to re-infection and constituted 8% of the cohort. The second group (N = 61) was apparently insusceptible to re-infection despite the continuing high levels of exposure and included 24% of the cohort. The other 68% of the cohort (N = 168) remained uninfected but were at most only moderately exposed, or had a status indeterminate due to non-compliance. This epidemiological identification of susceptibles and insusceptibles for schistosomiasis japonica' links field and ongoing laboratory studies aimed at characterising the genetic and immunological factors associated with resistance to re-infection and/or disease.},

abstract = {Swine are susceptible to the same influenza A virus subtypes as humans--H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2--and the histories of influenza in pigs and people are closely linked. Many swine influenza viruses are a result of reassortment and their genes are composed of human and avian and/or swine virus genes. Indeed, it is known that both human and avian influenza viruses occasionally transmit to pigs, and that pigs can serve as "mixing vessels" for these viruses, meaning that viruses can exchange genetic material and lead to the production of a new "hybrid" virus. This has led to the thinking that perhaps pandemic viruses could emerge following reassortment in pigs. However, since nobody has observed the start of a pandemic, there remains no direct evidence to make this more than a theory.},

title = {Diagnosis of schistosomiasis japonica in Chinese schoolchildren by administration of a questionnaire},
abstract = {This paper describes a rapid, simple, cost-effective questionnaire for screening school-aged children at risk for Asian schistosomiasis in China. Five hundred and thirty-two children, aged 8-14 years, were selected from 3 schools in an area moderately endemic for Schistosoma japonicum in Hunan province. The questionnaire, comprising 15 multiple-choice questions, was administered by teachers in order to collect both ethnographic and epidemiological data relevant to current S. japonicum infections. This was followed by Kato-Katz thick smear stool examinations, miracidium hatching tests, and soluble egg antigen-enzyme linked immunosorbent assays in order to validate the efficacy of the questionnaire approach. The results from a combination of all 3 procedures indicated that the overall schistosomiasis prevalence in the 3 schools was 29.9% (138/472). Six risk factors (episodes of diarrhoea, frequency of water contact, school grade attained, weakness, past history of S. japonicum infection(s), and whether a subject had been previously treated for schistosomiasis) in the questionnaire were determined by logistic regression to be highly statistically significant predictors of individual current infection. The sensitivity (93.7%), specificity (91.9%) and low cost (c. US{\$} 0.6/true positive case) associated with the 6 variables model make the questionnaire approach a very useful diagnostic tool for screening marshland and lake communities at high risk for schistosomiasis in China before selective treatment with praziquantel or diagnostic follow-up. An even simpler 3 variables 'yes/no' model was derived from the questionnaire and found to be nearly as good at predicting individual infection (sensitivity 86.2% and specificity exceeding 97.6%) and extremely simple to use. If validated in other ecological settings in China the questionnaire, modified or as presented here, could be adopted by the national schistosomiasis control programme.},

abstract = {The 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic was controlled by culling of infectious premises and pre-emptive culling intended to limit the spread of disease. Of the control strategies adopted, routine culling of farms that were contiguous to infected premises caused the most controversy. Here we perform a retrospective analysis of the culling of contiguous premises as performed in 2001 and a simulation study of the effects of this policy on reducing the number of farms affected by disease. Our simulation results support previous studies and show that a national policy of contiguous premises (CPs) culling leads to fewer farms losing livestock. The optimal national policy for controlling the 2001 epidemic is found to be the targeting of all contiguous premises, whereas for localized outbreaks in high animal density regions, more extensive fixed radius ring culling is optimal. Analysis of the 2001 data suggests that the lowest-risk CPs were generally prioritized for culling, however, even in this case, the policy is predicted to be effective. A sensitivity analysis and the development of a spatially heterogeneous policy show that the optimal culling level depends upon the basic reproductive ratio of the infection and the width of the dispersal kernel. These analyses highlight an important and probably quite general result: optimal control is highly dependent upon the distance over which the pathogen can be transmitted, the transmission rate of infection and local demography where the disease is introduced.},

In the pandemic alert period, recommendations include isolation of patients and quarantine of contacts, accompanied by antiviral therapy. During the pandemic period, the focus shifts to delaying spread and reducing effects through population-based measures. Ill persons should remain home when they first become symptomatic, but forced isolation and quarantine are ineffective and impractical. If the pandemic is severe, social distancing measures such as school closures should be considered. Nonessential domestic travel to affected areas should be deferred. Hand and respiratory hygiene should be routine; mask use should be based on setting and risk, and contaminated household surfaces should be disinfected. Additional research and field assessments during pandemics are essential to update recommendations. Legal authority and procedures for implementing interventions should be understood in advance and should respect cultural differences and human rights.},

title = {Schistosoma mansoni in infants (aged < 3 years) along the Ugandan shoreline of Lake Victoria},
abstract = {In two complementary epidemiological surveys of villages on the Ugandan shoreline of Lake Victoria, the putative occurrence of intestinal schistosomiasis in the local infants (children aged < 3 years) was investigated. When, during the first survey, 136 mother-and-infant pairs from a total of 12 villages were studied, only 7% of the infants but 45% of the mothers were found to be egg-patent for Schistosoma mansoni infection. The use of dipstick tests for urine-circulating cathodic antigen indicated, however, a much higher prevalence, of approximately 40%, among the infants.In the second survey, urine samples and multiple, not single, stool samples were collected from another 19 mother-and-infant pairs in two of the 12 study villages (Bugoto and Bwondha), and a standardized questionnaire was implemented. The prevalence of egg-patent infection was then found to be markedly higher in the study infants from Bugoto (86%) than in those from Bwondha (25%). A greater level of mother-and-infant water contact, a higher abundance of (infected) Biomphalaria choanomphala, and an unusual lakeshore topology may explain why S. mansoni infection was so much more common in the Bugoto subjects than in the Bwondha. All but one of the infants studied in the second survey were found to be anaemic (with <110 g haemoglobin/litre). Taken together, these children were less likely to be found infected with hookworm (16%), Hymenolepis nana (11%) or Trichuris trichiura (5%) than with S. mansoni (47%).Infection with the parasites causing intestinal schistosomiasis can be common among the infants living in these lakeshore villages. Although the immediate and later-life clinical impacts of such infection have yet to be elucidated, such infants would probably benefit from regular de-worming. Mothers should be strongly encouraged to visit the nearest health-services clinic, with their infants, for any necessary anthelmintic treatment.},

title = {Influenza-associated morbidity in subtropical Taiwan},
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the characteristics of influenza-associated morbidity in subtropical Taiwan, corresponding to the seasonal patterns, weather, and co-circulation of influenza (sub)types, and other respiratory viruses, where the burden of influenza is poorly quantified. METHODS: This study applied the virus variation-guided Poisson seasonal regression models to evaluate the impact of epidemic influenza on morbidity in Taiwan for 1999-2006. The models allow for the adjusting of influenza-associated morbidity for factors such as annual trend, seasonality, temperature, relative humidity, influenza A (H1N1), A (H3N2), B, and respiratory syncytial virus. RESULTS: Influenza-associated morbidity was associated more strongly with temperature than relative humidity. Influenza A (H3N2) was more coordinated with other virus (sub)types than A (H1N1). Type B dominated simultaneously with A (H3N2) at times, whereas A (H3N2) and A (H1N1) rarely dominated simultaneously with each other. Epidemiologically, A (H3N2) appeared to be the dominant subtype (51%), followed by type B (39%) and then A (H1N1) (10%) for influenza-associated morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that seasonality and influenza (sub)types contribute significantly to influenza morbidity in subtropical Taiwan. This is important for influenza control managers who are involved actively in using epidemic and climate information to achieve influenza-reduction targets in subtropical regions.},

title = {Nonpharmaceutical interventions implemented by US cities during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic},
abstract = {CONTEXT: A critical question in pandemic influenza planning is the role nonpharmaceutical interventions might play in delaying the temporal effects of a pandemic, reducing the overall and peak attack rate, and reducing the number of cumulative deaths. Such measures could potentially provide valuable time for pandemic-strain vaccine and antiviral medication production and distribution. Optimally, appropriate implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions would decrease the burden on health care services and critical infrastructure. OBJECTIVES: To examine the implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions for epidemic mitigation in 43 cities in the continental United States from September 8, 1918, through February 22, 1919, and to determine whether city-to-city variation in mortality was associated with the timing, duration, and combination of nonpharmaceutical interventions; altered population susceptibility associated with prior pandemic waves; age and sex distribution; and population size and density. DESIGN AND SETTING: Historical archival research, and statistical and epidemiological analyses. Nonpharmaceutical interventions were grouped into 3 major categories: school closure; cancellation of public gatherings; and isolation and quarantine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weekly excess death rate (EDR); time from the activation of nonpharmaceutical interventions to the first peak EDR; the first peak weekly EDR; and cumulative EDR during the entire 24-week study period. RESULTS: There were 115,340 excess pneumonia and influenza deaths (EDR, 500/100,000 population) in the 43 cities during the 24 weeks analyzed. Every city adopted at least 1 of the 3 major categories of nonpharmaceutical interventions. School closure and public gathering bans activated concurrently represented the most common combination implemented in 34 cities (79%); this combination had a median duration of 4 weeks (range, 1-10 weeks) and was significantly associated with reductions in weekly EDR. The cities that implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions earlier had greater delays in reaching peak mortality (Spearman r = -0.74, P < .001), lower peak mortality rates (Spearman r = 0.31, P = .02), and lower total mortality (Spearman r = 0.37, P = .008). There was a statistically significant association between increased duration of nonpharmaceutical interventions and a reduced total mortality burden (Spearman r = -0.39, P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a strong association between early, sustained, and layered application of nonpharmaceutical interventions and mitigating the consequences of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the United States. In planning for future severe influenza pandemics, nonpharmaceutical interventions should be considered for inclusion as companion measures to developing effective vaccines and medications for prophylaxis and treatment.},

abstract = {A persistent infection in Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells by an influenza B virus (B/Tecumseh/63/80) has been established and characterized. Virus recovered from the persistent state titrated lower in relation to the parental wild-type (wt) that initiated the infection as measured by hemagglutination and egg and tissue culture infectious dose, suggesting that the virus is a less cytopathic variant of the original wt virus. The persistent virus (pv) has decreased cytopathology for both MDCK and primary chick kidney (PCK) cell lines, and exhibits different RNA and protein electrophoretic migrations. Plaques of the persistent virus are smaller and take longer to appear, indicating that the pv is a slower growing variant of the wt. The small plaque mutant phenotype may play a role in the maintenance of the persistent infection in MDCK cells. The pv differs from the wt antigenically and in its ability to form deposits of uric acid-like crystals beneath the culture monolayers.},

Such actions include avoiding situations that persons perceive to be risky, which can have negative health and economic effects. Therefore, we conducted a population-based survey of persons' precautionary actions in response to a hypothetical influenza pandemic. For the 5 European and 3 Asian regions that had been affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome, the pattern of reported precautionary action was broadly similar across the regions; approximately 75% of respondents reported that they would avoid public transportation and 20%-30% would try to stay indoors. Some regional differences were noted; Europeans were more likely than Asians to avoid places of entertainment, and Asians were more likely to avoid seeing physicians. This international survey provides insight into what might be expected during an influenza pandemic.},

title = {An object simulation model for modeling hypothetical disease epidemics - EpiFlex},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: EpiFlex is a flexible, easy to use computer model for a single computer, intended to be operated by one user who need not be an expert. Its purpose is to study in-silico the epidemic behavior of a wide variety of diseases, both known and theoretical, by simulating their spread at the level of individuals contracting and infecting others. To understand the system fully, this paper must be read together in conjunction with study of the software and its results. EpiFlex is evaluated using results from modeling influenza A epidemics and comparing them with a variety of field data sources and other types of modeling.EpiFlex is an object-oriented Monte Carlo system, allocating entities to correspond to individuals, disease vectors, diseases, and the locations that hosts may inhabit. EpiFlex defines eight different contact types available for a disease. Contacts occur inside locations within the model. Populations are composed of demographic groups, each of which has a cycle of movement between locations. Within locations, superspreading is defined by skewing of contact distributions. RESULTS: EpiFlex indicates three phenomena of interest for public health: (1) R0 is variable, and the smaller the population, the larger the infected fraction within that population will be; (2) significant compression/synchronization between cities by a factor of roughly 2 occurs between the early incubation phase of a multi-city epidemic and the major manifestation phase; (3) if better true morbidity data were available, more asymptomatic hosts would be seen to spread disease than we currently believe is the case for influenza. These results suggest that field research to study such phenomena, while expensive, should be worthwhile. CONCLUSION: Since EpiFlex shows all stages of disease progression, detailed insight into the progress of epidemics is possible. EpiFlex shows the characteristic multimodality and apparently random variation characteristic of real world data, but does so as an emergent property of a carefully constructed model of disease dynamics and is not simply a stochastic system. EpiFlex can provide a better understanding of infectious diseases and strategies for response.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: H1N2 is one of the main subtypes of influenza, which circulates in swine all over the world. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and genetic of H1N2 in swine of China. STUDY DESIGN: Two H1N2 swine influenza viruses were isolated from Tianjin and Guangdong province of China in 2004 and 2006, respectively. The molecular evolution of eight gene segments was analyzed. RESULT: A/Swine/Tianjin/1/2004 has low identity with A/Swine/Guangdong/2006; in the phylogenetic tree of PA gene, A/Swine/Guangdong/1/2006 and A/Swine/Guangxi/1/2006 along with the H1N2 swine isolates of North America formed a cluster; and A/Swine/Tianjin/2004 and A/Swine/Zhejiang/2004, along with the classical H1N1 swine isolates formed another cluster; except that NA gene of A/Swine/Tianjin/1/2004 fell into the cluster of the H3N2 human influenza virus, indicating the reassortment between H3N2 human and H1N1 swine influenza viruses. CONCLUSION: Two different genotypes of H1N2 appeared among pigs in China. A/swine/Guangdong/1/06 was probably from H1N2 swine influenza viruses of North America; while A/swine/Tianjin/1/04 maybe come from reassortments of classical H1N1 swine and H3N2 human viruses prevalent in North America.},

title = {Measuring exposure to S. japonicum in China. II. Activity diaries, pathways to infection and immunological correlates},
abstract = {In this study we examine the pathways to schistosomiasis exposure and infection among residents residing on two islands (large, Qingshan; small, Niangashan) in the Dongting Lake region (Hunan province) of China. An exposure model, based on activity diaries, was used to quantify an individual's square-metre-minute (sq.m.min) daily water contact. Subjects living on the small island had a significantly higher (P=0.0002) degree of exposure (mean+/-S.D., 13.2+/-11.0 sq.m.min) than individuals dwelling on the large island (mean+/-S.D., 5.5+/-7.1 sq.m.min). Participants identified as stool egg positive (mean+/-S.D., 8.3+/-10.4 sq.m.min) had higher exposures than for those never treated (mean+/-S.D., 2.2+/-3.4 sq.m.min) for schistosomiasis, and these high exposures rose steadily to peak at 35-49 years of age and decline after age 50. This exposure pattern differs markedly from those reported for African or South American schistosomiasis. The majority of human water contact occurs on the lake. Egg-positive subjects reported significantly higher (P < 0.05) episodes of water contact on the lake versus their egg-negative counterparts, who reported significantly higher (P < 0.01) exposure at the aquaculture ponds. The results of path analysis revealed that sex, age, island of residence and whether a fisherman or not were the most highly significant independent predictors of lake exposure. This accounted for approximately 40% (R2=0.39) of the total lake exposure. Exposure to lake water was a strong predictor (P=0.0006) of past infection and a modest predictor (P=0.05) of current infection.},

title = {Transmissibility of 1918 pandemic influenza},
abstract = {The 1918 influenza pandemic killed 20-40 million people worldwide, and is seen as a worst-case scenario for pandemic planning. Like other pandemic influenza strains, the 1918 A/H1N1 strain spread extremely rapidly. A measure of transmissibility and of the stringency of control measures required to stop an epidemic is the reproductive number, which is the number of secondary cases produced by each primary case. Here we obtained an estimate of the reproductive number for 1918 influenza by fitting a deterministic SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model to pneumonia and influenza death epidemic curves from 45 US cities: the median value is less than three. The estimated proportion of the population with A/H1N1 immunity before September 1918 implies a median basic reproductive number of less than four. These results strongly suggest that the reproductive number for 1918 pandemic influenza is not large relative to many other infectious diseases. In theory, a similar novel influenza subtype could be controlled. But because influenza is frequently transmitted before a specific diagnosis is possible and there is a dearth of global antiviral and vaccine stores, aggressive transmission reducing measures will probably be required.},

abstract = {Since April 15 and 17, 2009, when the first two cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) infection were identified from two southern California counties, novel influenza A (H1N1) cases have been documented throughout the world, with most cases occurring in the United States and Mexico. In the United States, early reports of illnesses associated with novel influenza A (H1N1) infection indicated the disease might be similar in severity to seasonal influenza, with the majority of patients not requiring hospitalization and only rare deaths reported, generally in persons with underlying medical conditions. As of May 17, 2009, 553 novel influenza A (H1N1) cases, including 333 confirmed and 220 probable cases, had been reported in 32 of 61 local health jurisdictions in California. Of the 553 patients, 30 have been hospitalized. No fatal cases associated with novel influenza A (H1N1) infection had been reported in California. This report summarizes the 30 hospitalized cases as of May 17, including a detailed description of four cases that illustrate the spectrum of illness severity and underlying risk factors. This preliminary overview indicates that, although the majority of hospitalized persons infected with novel influenza A (H1N1) recovered without complications, certain patients had severe and prolonged disease. All hospitalized patients with novel influenza A (H1N1) infection should be monitored carefully and treated with antiviral therapy, including patients who seek care >48 hours after illness onset.},

title = {Elastase-Dependent Live Attenuated Swine Influenza A Viruses Are Immunogenic and Confer Protection against Swine Influenza A Virus Infection in Pigs},
abstract = {Influenza A viruses cause significant morbidity in swine, resulting in a substantial economic burden. Swine influenza virus (SIV) infection also poses important human public health concerns. Vaccination is the primary method for the prevention of influenza virus infection. Previously, we generated two elastase-dependent mutant SIVs derived from A/Sw/Saskatchewan/18789/02(H1N1): A/Sw/Sk-R345V (R345V) and A/Sw/Sk-R345A (R345A). These two viruses are highly attenuated in pigs, making them good candidates for a live-virus vaccine. In this study, the immunogenicity and the ability of these candidates to protect against SIV infection were evaluated in pigs. We report that intratracheally administrated R345V and R345A induced antigen-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity characterized by increased production of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibodies in the serum and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, high hemagglutination inhibition titers in serum, an enhanced level of lymphocyte proliferation, and higher numbers of gamma interferon-secreting cells at the site of infection. Based on the immunogenicity results, the R345V virus was further tested in a protection trial in which pigs were vaccinated twice with R345V and then challenged with homologous A/Sw/Saskatchewan/18789/02, H1N1 antigenic variant A/Sw/Indiana/1726/88 or heterologous subtypic H3N2 A/Sw/Texas/4199-2/9/98. Our data showed that two vaccinations with R345V provided pigs with complete protection from homologous H1N1 SIV infection and partial protection from heterologous subtypic H3N2 SIV infection. This protection was characterized by significantly reduced macroscopic and microscopic lung lesions, lower virus titers from the respiratory tract, and lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, elastase-dependent SIV mutants can be used as live-virus vaccines against swine influenza in pigs.},

title = {Description of an epidemic simulation model for use in evaluating strategies to control an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a spatial epidemic model to simulate intraherd and interherd transmission of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus. SAMPLE POPULATION: 2,238 herds, representing beef, dairy, swine, goats, and sheep, and 5 sale yards located in Fresno, Kings, and Tulare counties of California. PROCEDURE: Using Monte-Carlo simulations, a spatial stochastic epidemic simulation model was developed to identify new herds that would acquire FMD following random selection of an index herd and to assess progression of an epidemic after implementation of mandatory control strategies. RESULTS: The model included species-specific transition periods for FMD infection, locations of herds, rates of direct and indirect contacts among herds, and probability distributions derived from expert opinions on probabilities of transmission by direct and indirect contact, as well as reduction in contact following implementation of restrictions on movements in designated infected areas and surveillance zones. Models of supplemental control programs included slaughter of all animals within a specified distance of infected herds, slaughter of only high-risk animals identified by use of a model simulation, and vaccination of all animals within a 5- to 50-km radius of infected herds. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The FMD model represents a tool for use in planning biosecurity and emergency-response programs and in comparing potential benefits of various strategies for control and eradication of FMD appropriate for specific populations.},

title = {Multiplex PCR tests sentinel the appearance of pandemic influenza viruses including H1N1 swine influenza},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since the turn of the century seven new respiratory viruses have infected man and two of these have resulted in worldwide epidemics. Both SARS Coronavirus which quickly spread to 29 countries in February 2003 and H1N1 swine influenza that recently spread from Mexico to 30 countries in three weeks represent major pandemic threats for mankind. Diagnostic assays are required to detect novel influenza strains with pandemic potential. OBJECTIVE: In this report we evaluate the ability of a multiplex PCR test (xTAG RVP) to detect new, "non-seasonal" influenza viruses including the H1N1 swine influenza A/swine/California/04/2009. STUDY DESIGN: Laboratory based study using retrospective and prospective specimens. RESULTS: This multiplex PCR test detected the present of non-seasonal (non-H1, non-H3) influenza in 20 of 20 patients infected with H1N1 swine flu virus. In addition to detecting the current swine flu the xTAG RVP test detected the H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 high pathogenicity avian influenza virus that circulated in South East Asia in 2003 as well as 17 out of 17 influenza A viruses representing 11 HA subtypes isolated from birds, swine and horses not yet seen in the human population. CONCLUSION: Based on these results we believe that this molecular test can perform an important role as a sentinel test to detect novel non-seasonal influenza A viruses in patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) and therefore act as an early warning system for the detection of future pandemic influenza threats.},

title = {Space and contact networks: capturing the locality of disease transmission},
abstract = {While an arbitrary level of complexity may be included in simulations of spatial epidemics, computational intensity and analytical intractability mean that such models often lack transparency into the determinants of epidemiological dynamics. Although numerous approaches attempt to resolve this complexity-tractability trade-off, moment closure methods arguably offer the most promising and robust frameworks for capturing the role of the locality of contact processes on global disease dynamics. While a close analogy may be made between full stochastic spatial transmission models and dynamic network models, we consider here the special case where the dynamics of the network topology change on time-scales much longer than the epidemiological processes imposed on them; in such cases, the use of static network models are justified. We show that in such cases, static network models may provide excellent approximations to the underlying spatial contact process through an appropriate choice of the effective neighbourhood size. We also demonstrate the robustness of this mapping by examining the equivalence of deterministic approximations to the full spatial and network models derived under third-order moment closure assumptions. For systems where deviation from homogeneous mixing is limited, we show that pair equations developed for network models are at least as good an approximation to the underlying stochastic spatial model as more complex spatial moment equations, with both classes of approximation becoming less accurate only for highly localized kernels.},

abstract = {In April 2009, CDC reported the first two cases in the United States of human infection with a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus. As of July 6, a total of 122 countries had reported 94,512 cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection, 429 of which were fatal; in the United States, a total of 33,902 cases were reported, 170 of which were fatal. Cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection have included rapidly progressive lower respiratory tract disease resulting in respiratory failure, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Since April 26, communitywide transmission of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus has occurred in Michigan, with 655 probable and confirmed cases reported as of June 18 (Michigan Department of Community Health [MDCH], unpublished data, 2009). This report summarizes the clinical characteristics of a series of 10 patients with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection and ARDS at a tertiary-care ICU in Michigan. Of the 10 patients, nine were obese (body mass index [BMI] >or=30), including seven who were extremely obese (BMI =40); five had pulmonary emboli; and nine had multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Three patients died. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for severe complications of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection, particularly in extremely obese patients.},

title = {Severe community acquired pneumonia: a one-year analysis in a tertiary referral intensive care unit},
abstract = {AIMS: To define outcomes, characteristics, microbiology and salient prognostic factors of patients admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) with severe community acquired pneumonia, over a one year period. METHODS: All adult patients with severe community acquired pneumonia admitted between July 1997 and July 1998 were studied. Data were extracted by retrospective chart review. Variables assessed included underlying conditions and baseline physical parameters. Evolutionary variables eg, septic shock and laboratory data including microbiology and arterial blood gas determinants were also assessed. Prognostic factors were determined by comparison of the above variables between survivors and non-survivors. The prognostic value of the British Thoracic Society discriminant 'rule one' was assessed. Results. 32 patients were assessed. ICU mortality was 31%. 84% of patients had co-morbidity. The average age was 58.5 (SD 17.4) years and the average APACHE 11 score was 20.37 (SD 9.12). A microbiological diagnosis was made in 40%. Mortality was not increased in those in whom a bacterial diagnosis was not made. Commonest pathogens isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (46%), gram negative organisms (29%) and Staphylococcus aureus (23%). Prognostic factors on and during ICU admission were the need for mechanical ventilation (p=0.0003), septic shock (p=0.02), inotrope requirement (p=0.003), low serum albumin (p=0.041), base deficit (p=0.04), INR (p=0.02) and inspired oxygen concentration (p=0.003). On initial admission to hospital the presence of bilateral pneumonia was the only variable correlated with outcome (p=0.01). The British Thoracic Society 'rule one' did not correlate with death either on admission to hospital or ICU. CONCLUSIONS: Severe community acquired pneumonia carries a high mortality despite ICU management. Bacterial diagnostic rate was low but made no difference to mortality. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the commonest causative pathogen. The development of septic shock, requirement for mechanical ventilation and bilateral disease are important adverse prognostic indicators.},

title = {Amplification of four genes of influenza A viruses using a degenerate primer set in a one step RT-PCR method},
abstract = {We designed a degenerate primer set that yielded full-length amplification of hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M), and non-structural protein (NSP) genes of influenza A viruses in a single reaction mixture. These four genes were amplified from 15 HA (1-15) and 9 NA (1-9) subtypes of influenza A viruses of avian (n=16) origin. In addition, 272 field isolates of avian origin were tested by this method. Full-length amplification of HA, NA, M, and NSP genes was obtained in 242 (88.9%), 254 (93.4%), 268 (98.5%), and 268 (98.5%) isolates, respectively. No gene was amplified in four isolates. Of these four isolates, two were subtyped as H4N6, one as H7N7, and one as H10N7. Amplification was successful for all 4 genes of H1N1, H2N3, and H3N2 isolates of swine influenza. Also, all four genes were amplified in one equine influenza (H3N8) isolate and seven isolates of human origin (H1N1 and H3N2). This appears to be the first study using degenerate primer set for full-length amplification of four genes of influenza A viruses in a single reaction. Further studies are needed to determine if this primer set can be used for subtyping of influenza virus isolates.},

title = {Initial human transmission dynamics of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in North America},
abstract = {Background Between 5 and 25 April 2009, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 caused a substantial, severe outbreak in Mexico, and subsequently developed into the first global pandemic in 41 years. We determined the reproduction number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 by analyzing the dynamics of the complete case series in Mexico City during this early period. Methods We analyzed three mutually exclusive datasets from Mexico City Distrito Federal which constituted all suspect cases from 15 March to 25 April: confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infections, non-pandemic influenza A infections and patients who tested negative for influenza. We estimated the initial reproduction number from 497 suspect cases identified prior to 20 April, using a novel contact network methodology incorporating dates of symptom onset and hospitalization, variation in contact rates, extrinsic sociological factors, and uncertainties in underreporting and disease progression. We tested the robustness of this estimate using both the subset of laboratory-confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infections and an extended case series through 25 April, adjusted for suspected ascertainment bias. Results The initial reproduction number (95% confidence interval range) for this novel virus is 1.51 (1.32-1.71) based on suspected cases and 1.43 (1.29-1.57) based on confirmed cases before 20 April. The longer time series (through 25 April) yielded a higher estimate of 2.04 (1.84-2.25), which reduced to 1.44 (1.38-1.51) after correction for ascertainment bias. Conclusions The estimated transmission characteristics of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 suggest that pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures may appreciably limit its spread prior the development of an effective vaccine.},

title = {Recombinant paramyosin (rec-Sj-97) tested for immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy against Schistosoma japonicum in mice and water buffaloes},
abstract = {A primary vaccine candidate antigen against schistosomiasis is paramyosin (pmy), a myofibrillar protein found exclusively in invertebrates. Here we report the results of vaccine trials against the Asian schistosome undertaken on inbred and outbred mice and water buffaloes using a bacterially expressed and purified form of Schistosoma japonicum pmy (rec-Sj-97). Vaccination of the mice resulted in high levels of specific anti-pmy IgG antibodies when compared with adjuvant controls and significant reduction in worm burdens and in liver eggs. Furthermore, a significant reduction in liver eggs was recorded in two of the three water buffalo vaccine trials undertaken and, in all three trials, high levels of specific anti-pmy IgG antibodies were generated. There was no evidence of any toxic effects and the vaccine preparations and Quil A adjuvant were clearly well tolerated. The development of a vaccine intended for livestock animals such as bovines would be beneficial in two ways; directly by blocking transmission of schistosomiasis to humans and economically by contributing to healthier livestock. We are encouraged by the consistent efficacy in the mouse and the buffalo vaccine trials that resulted in a significant decrease in liver eggs. Indeed, predictions from mathematical models indicate that an egg reduction effect of 42-45% in buffaloes would be sufficient when combined with human treatment to control schistosomiasis japonica in the marshes and lakes along the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the most highly endemic areas for the disease in China.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are isolated reports of Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome (GBS) after receiving vaccination. OBJECTIVE: To determine the rates and characteristics of GBS after administration of vaccination in United States METHODS: We used data for 1990 to 2005 from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which is a cooperative program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration. RESULTS: There were 1000 cases (mean age, 47 years) of GBS reported after vaccination in the United States between 1990 and 2005. The onset of GBS was within 6 weeks in 774 cases, >6 weeks in 101, and unknown in 125. Death and disability after the event occurred in 32 (3.2%) and 167 (16.7%) subjects, respectively. The highest number (n = 632) of GBS cases was observed in subjects receiving influenza vaccine followed by hepatitis B vaccine (n = 94). Other vaccines or combinations of vaccines were associated with 274 cases of GBS. The incidence of GBS after influenza vaccination was marginally higher in subjects <65 years compared with those >or=65 years (P = 0.09); for hepatitis vaccine, the incidence was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in the <65 group. Death was more frequent in subjects >or=65 years compared with those <65 years (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that vaccines other than influenza vaccine can be associated with GBS. Vaccination-related GBS results in death or disability in one fifth of affected individuals, which is comparable to the reported rates in the general GBS population.},

title = {Prevalence of influenza A and B antibodies in pregnant women and their offspring},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in pregnant women and neonates, but few countries offer annual influenza vaccination with the inactivated vaccine to all women who are, or intend to become, pregnant. OBJECTIVES: To provide seroepidemiological information on influenza A and B antibodies in pregnant women and their offspring in Germany. STUDY DESIGN: Anti-influenza antibodies were determined using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) on serum obtained from 209 women and their newborns at delivery. RESULTS: The prevalence of antibodies against influenza A virus was 93.8% [89.6-96.6%] in the mothers and 96.7% [93.2-98.6%] in the newborns. The prevalence of antibodies against influenza B virus was 42.1% [35.3-49.1%] in the mothers and 78.5% [72.3-83.8%] in their newborns, which was a significant difference. The antibody concentrations against both influenza A and influenza B viruses were significantly lower in mother than in their newborns. CONCLUSIONS: Because of active placental transport of IgG antibodies, neonates have higher prevalence and/or concentrations of influenza A and B virus-specific antibodies induced by natural infections than their mothers. Considering these serological findings, especially the lower prevalence of maternal antibody against influenza B virus, annual influenza vaccination may improve the protection of pregnant women and their offspring against influenza.},

title = {Contact tracing and disease control},
abstract = {Contact tracing, followed by treatment or isolation, is a key control measure in the battle against infectious diseases. It is an extreme form of locally targeted control, and as such has the potential to be highly efficient when dealing with low numbers of cases. For this reason it is frequently used to combat sexually transmitted diseases and new invading pathogens. Accurate modelling of contact tracing requires explicit information about the disease-transmission pathways from each individual, and hence the network of contacts. Here, pairwise-approximation methods and full stochastic simulations are used to investigate the utility of contact tracing. A simple relationship is found between the efficiency of contact tracing necessary for eradication and the basic reproductive ratio of the disease. This holds for a wide variety of realistic situations including heterogeneous networks containing core-groups or super-spreaders, and asymptomatic individuals. Clustering (transitivity) within the transmission network is found to destroy the relationship, requiring lower efficiency than predicted.},

title = {Dynamic social networks and the implications for the spread of infectious disease},
abstract = {Understanding the nature of human contact patterns is crucial for predicting the impact of future pandemics and devising effective control measures. However, few studies provide a quantitative description of the aspects of social interactions that are most relevant to disease transmission. Here, we present the results from a detailed diary-based survey of casual (conversational) and close contact (physical) encounters made by a small peer group of 49 adults who recorded 8,661 encounters with 3,528 different individuals over 14 non-consecutive days. We find that the stability of interactions depends on the intimacy of contact and social context. Casual contact encounters mostly occur in the workplace and are predominantly irregular, while close contact encounters mostly occur at home or in social situations and tend to be more stable. Simulated epidemics of casual contact transmission involve a large number of non-repeated encounters, and the social network is well captured by a random mixing model. However, the stability of the social network should be taken into account for close contact infections. Our findings have implications for the modelling of human epidemics and planning pandemic control policies based on social distancing methods.},

Here we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating epidemiological parameters of the 2001 outbreak for a range of simple transmission models. We make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001, equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with FMD were not infectious, even if some were infected. We estimate how transmission parameters varied through time, highlighting the impact of the control measures on the progression of the epidemic. We demonstrate statistically significant evidence for assortative contact patterns between animals of the same species. Predictive risk maps of the transmission potential in different geographic areas of GB are presented for the fitted models.},

title = {Accuracy of models for the 2001 foot-and-mouth epidemic},
abstract = {Since 2001 models of the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, supported by the data from the UK epidemic, have been expounded as some of the best examples of problem-driven epidemic models. These claims are generally based on a comparison between model results and epidemic data at fairly coarse spatio-temporal resolution. Here, we focus on a comparison between model and data at the individual farm level, assessing the potential of the model to predict the infectious status of farms in both the short and long terms. Although the accuracy with which the model predicts farms reporting infection is between 5 and 15%, these low levels are attributable to the expected level of variation between epidemics, and are comparable to the agreement between two independent model simulations. By contrast, while the accuracy of predicting culls is higher (20-30%), this is lower than expected from the comparison between model epidemics. These results generally support the contention that the type of the model used in 2001 was a reliable representation of the epidemic process, but highlight the difficulties of predicting the complex human response, in terms of control strategies to the perceived epidemic risk.},

title = {Large-scale sequencing of human influenza reveals the dynamic nature of viral genome evolution},
abstract = {Influenza viruses are remarkably adept at surviving in the human population over a long timescale. The human influenza A virus continues to thrive even among populations with widespread access to vaccines, and continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The virus mutates from year to year, making the existing vaccines ineffective on a regular basis, and requiring that new strains be chosen for a new vaccine. Less-frequent major changes, known as antigenic shift, create new strains against which the human population has little protective immunity, thereby causing worldwide pandemics. The most recent pandemics include the 1918 'Spanish' flu, one of the most deadly outbreaks in recorded history, which killed 30-50 million people worldwide, the 1957 'Asian' flu, and the 1968 'Hong Kong' flu. Motivated by the need for a better understanding of influenza evolution, we have developed flexible protocols that make it possible to apply large-scale sequencing techniques to the highly variable influenza genome. Here we report the results of sequencing 209 complete genomes of the human influenza A virus, encompassing a total of 2,821,103 nucleotides. In addition to increasing markedly the number of publicly available, complete influenza virus genomes, we have discovered several anomalies in these first 209 genomes that demonstrate the dynamic nature of influenza transmission and evolution. This new, large-scale sequencing effort promises to provide a more comprehensive picture of the evolution of influenza viruses and of their pattern of transmission through human and animal populations. All data from this project are being deposited, without delay, in public archives.},

title = {Absolute humidity modulates influenza survival, transmission, and seasonality},
abstract = {Influenza A incidence peaks during winter in temperate regions. The basis for this pronounced seasonality is not understood, nor is it well documented how influenza A transmission principally occurs. Previous studies indicate that relative humidity (RH) affects both influenza virus transmission (IVT) and influenza virus survival (IVS). Here, we reanalyze these data to explore the effects of absolute humidity on IVT and IVS. We find that absolute humidity (AH) constrains both transmission efficiency and IVS much more significantly than RH. In the studies presented, 50% of IVT variability and 90% of IVS variability are explained by AH, whereas, respectively, only 12% and 36% are explained by RH. In temperate regions, both outdoor and indoor AH possess a strong seasonal cycle that minimizes in winter. This seasonal cycle is consistent with a wintertime increase in IVS and IVT and may explain the seasonality of influenza. Thus, differences in AH provide a single, coherent, more physically sound explanation for the observed variability of IVS, IVT and influenza seasonality in temperate regions. This hypothesis can be further tested through future, additional laboratory, epidemiological and modeling studies.},

Oseltamivir-resistant influenza viruses A (H1N1) (ORVs) with H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase emerged independently of drug use. By country, the proportion of ORVs ranged from 0% to 68%, with the highest proportion in Norway. The average weighted prevalence of ORVs across Europe increased gradually over time, from near 0 in week 40 of 2007 to 56% in week 19 of 2008 (mean 20%). Neuraminidase genes of ORVs possessing the H275Y substitution formed a homogeneous subgroup closely related to, but distinguishable from, those of oseltamivir-sensitive influenza viruses A (H1N1). Minor variants of ORVs emerged independently, indicating multiclonal ORVs. Overall, the clinical effect of ORVs in Europe, measured by influenza-like illness or acute respiratory infection, was unremarkable and consistent with normal seasonal activity.},

abstract = {The optimal method for identifying respiratory viruses in adults has not been established. The objective of the study was to compare the sensitivity of three sampling methods for this purpose. One thousand participants were included (mean age 63.1+/-17.8 years). Of these 550 were patients hospitalized for acute febrile lower respiratory tract infections and 450 were controls. Oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and nasopharyngeal washings (NPW) were obtained from each participant and were tested for 12 respiratory viruses by multiplex based real time PCR (mqRT-PCR). Patients were defined as positive for a specific virus if the virus was identified by at least one sampling method. In all, 251 viruses were identified in 244 participants. For the detection of any virus sensitivity rates for OPS, NPS and NPW were 54.2%, 73.3%, and 84.9%, respectively (OPS vs. NPS and NPW P< 0.00001; NPS vs. NPW P<0.003). Maximal sensitivity was obtained only with sampling by all three methods. The same gradation of sensitivity for the three sampling methods was found when influenza viruses, coronaviruses and rhinoviruses were analyzed separately. The three sampling methods yielded equal sensitivity rates for RSV. We conclude that nasopharyngeal sampling has a higher sensitivity rate than oropharyngeal sampling and NPW has a higher sensitivity than NPS with rigid cotton swab for the identification of respiratory viruses in adults. Sampling by all three methods is required for maximal detection of respiratory viruses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As yet, no one has written a comprehensive epidemiologic account of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak from an affected country. OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive epidemiologic account of a SARS outbreak from an affected territory. DESIGN: Epidemiologic analysis. SETTING: The 2003 Hong Kong SARS outbreak. PARTICIPANTS: All 1755 cases and 302 deaths. MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic characteristics; infection clusters by time, occupation, setting, and workplace; and geospatial relationships were determined. The mean and variance in the time from infection to onset (incubation period) were estimated in a small group of patients with known exposure. The mean and variance in time from onset to admission, from admission to discharge, or from admission to death were calculated. Logistic regression was used to identify important predictors of case fatality. RESULTS: 49.3% of patients were infected in clinics, hospitals, or elderly or nursing homes, and the Amoy Gardens cluster accounted for 18.8% of cases. The ratio of women to men among infected individuals was 5:4. Health care workers accounted for 23.1% of all reported cases. The estimated mean incubation period was 4.6 days (95% CI, 3.8 to 5.8 days). Mean time from symptom onset to hospitalization varied between 2 and 8 days, decreasing over the course of the epidemic. Mean time from onset to death was 23.7 days (CI, 22.0 to 25.3 days), and mean time from onset to discharge was 26.5 days (CI, 25.8 to 27.2 days). Increasing age, male sex, atypical presenting symptoms, presence of comorbid conditions, and high lactate dehydrogenase level on admission were associated with a greater risk for death. LIMITATIONS: Estimates of the incubation period relied on statistical assumptions because few patients had known exposure times. Temporal changes in case management as the epidemic progressed, unavailable treatment information, and several potentially important factors that could not be thoroughly analyzed because of the limited sample size complicate interpretation of factors related to case fatality. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of the complete data on the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong has revealed key epidemiologic features of the epidemic as it evolved.},

title = {Social contacts and mixing patterns relevant to the spread of infectious diseases},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.},

title = {Using validation sets for outcomes and exposure to infection in vaccine field studies},
abstract = {Methods of adjusting for bias in estimates due to mismeasured or missing covariates and outcomes through the use of validation sets have been developed in many types of health studies. These methods can be employed for the efficient design and analysis of vaccine studies as well. On the one hand, nonspecific case definitions can lead to attenuated efficacy and effectiveness estimates, but confirmation by culture or a quick test of the infectious agent is also expensive and difficult. On the other hand, data on exposure to infection can influence estimates of vaccine efficacy, but good data on exposure are difficult to obtain. In this paper, the authors show how use of small validation sets can correct the bias of the estimates obtained from a large main study while maintaining efficiency. They illustrate the approach for outcomes using the example of influenza vaccine efficacy and effectiveness trials and illustrate the approach for exposure to infection using the example of a human immunodeficiency virus vaccine trial. The authors discuss challenges posed by infectious diseases in the use of currently available methods. Development of these efficient designs and methods of analysis for vaccine field studies will improve estimation of vaccine efficacy for both susceptibility and infectiousness, as well as estimation of indirect and overall effects of vaccination in community trials.},

We examined the effect of solar radiation, dew point, temperature and geographical position on the city-specific timing of epidemics in the USA. Using paediatric in-patient data from hospitals in 35 cities for each influenza season in the study period 2000-2005, we determined 'epidemic timing' by identifying the week of peak influenza activity. For each city we calculated averages of daily climate measurements for 1 October to 31 December. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to assess the strength of association between each variable and epidemic timing. Of the climate variables only solar radiation was significantly related to epidemic timing (95% CI -0.027 to -0.0032). Future studies may elucidate biological mechanisms intrinsically linked to solar radiation that contribute to epidemic timing in temperate regions.},

abstract = {Preparedness for a possible influenza pandemic caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza A subtype H5N1 has become a global priority. The spread of the virus to Europe and continued human infection in Southeast Asia have heightened pandemic concern. It remains unknown from where the pandemic strain may emerge; current attention is directed at Vietnam, Thailand, and, more recently, Indonesia and China. Here, we report that genetically and antigenically distinct sublineages of H5N1 virus have become established in poultry in different geographical regions of Southeast Asia, indicating the long-term endemicity of the virus, and the isolation of H5N1 virus from apparently healthy migratory birds in southern China. Our data show that H5N1 influenza virus, has continued to spread from its established source in southern China to other regions through transport of poultry and bird migration. The identification of regionally distinct sublineages contributes to the understanding of the mechanism for the perpetuation and spread of H5N1, providing information that is directly relevant to control of the source of infection in poultry. It points to the necessity of surveillance that is geographically broader than previously supposed and that includes H5N1 viruses of greater genetic and antigenic diversity.},

abstract = {Mathematical models of disease transmission processes can serve as platforms for integration of diverse data, including site-specific information, for the purpose of designing strategies for minimizing transmission. A model describing the transmission of schistosomiasis is adapted to incorporate field data typically developed in disease control efforts in the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in China, with the object of exploring the feasibility of model-based control strategies. The model is studied using computer simulation methods. Mechanistically based models of this sort typically have a large number of parameters that pose challenges in reducing parametric uncertainty to levels that will produce predictions sufficiently precise to discriminate among competing control options. We describe here an approach to parameter estimation that uses a recently developed statistical procedure called Bayesian melding to sequentially reduce parametric uncertainty as field data are accumulated over several seasons. Preliminary results of applying the approach to a historical data set in southwestern Sichuan are promising. Moreover, technologic advances using the global positioning system, remote sensing, and geographic information systems promise cost-effective improvements in the nature and quality of field data. This, in turn, suggests that the utility of the modeling approach will increase over time.},

Eighteen human cases of disease were recorded, six of which were fatal. This unique virus was eliminated through total depopulation of all poultry markets and chicken farms in December 1997. Other outbreaks of high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) caused by H5N1 viruses occurred in poultry in 2001 and 2002. These H5N1 viruses isolated had different internal gene constellations to those isolated in 1997. No new cases of infection or disease in man due to these or other H5N1 viruses have been reported.

title = {[SI] Strategies for mitigating an influenza pandemic},
abstract = {Development of strategies for mitigating the severity of a new influenza pandemic is now a top global public health priority. Influenza prevention and containment strategies can be considered under the broad categories of antiviral, vaccine and non-pharmaceutical (case isolation, household quarantine, school or workplace closure, restrictions on travel) measures. Mathematical models are powerful tools for exploring this complex landscape of intervention strategies and quantifying the potential costs and benefits of different options. Here we use a large-scale epidemic simulation to examine intervention options should initial containment of a novel influenza outbreak fail, using Great Britain and the United States as examples. We find that border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread by more than 2-3 weeks unless more than 99% effective. School closure during the peak of a pandemic can reduce peak attack rates by up to 40%, but has little impact on overall attack rates, whereas case isolation or household quarantine could have a significant impact, if feasible. Treatment of clinical cases can reduce transmission, but only if antivirals are given within a day of symptoms starting. Given enough drugs for 50% of the population, household-based prophylaxis coupled with reactive school closure could reduce clinical attack rates by 40-50%. More widespread prophylaxis would be even more logistically challenging but might reduce attack rates by over 75%. Vaccine stockpiled in advance of a pandemic could significantly reduce attack rates even if of low efficacy. Estimates of policy effectiveness will change if the characteristics of a future pandemic strain differ substantially from those seen in past pandemics.},

abstract = {Many of the remaining challenges in infectious disease control involve pathogens that fail to elicit long-lasting immunity in their hosts. Antigenic variation is a common reason for this failure and a contributor to the complexity of vaccine design. Diversifying selection by the host immune system is commonly, and often correctly, invoked to explain antigenic variability in pathogens. However, there is a wide variety of patterns of antigenic variation across space and time, and within and between hosts, and we do not yet understand the determinants of these different patterns. This review describes five such patterns, taking as examples two bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis), two viruses (influenza A and HIV-1), as well as the pathogens (taken as a group) for which antigenic variation is negligible. Pathogen-specific explanations for these patterns of diversity are critically evaluated, and the patterns are compared against predictions of theoretical models for antigenic diversity. Major remaining challenges are highlighted, including the identification of key protective antigens in bacteria, the design of vaccines to combat antigenic variability for viruses and the development of more systematic explanations for patterns of antigenic variation.},

abstract = {Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Annual influenza vaccination was first recommended for children aged 6-23 months in 2004 and for children aged 24-59 months in 2006. In August 2008, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) expanded its recommendations to include all children aged 5-18 years, beginning with the 2008-09 influenza season. Among children aged 6 months--8 years, previously unvaccinated children and children who received only 1 vaccine dose for the first time in the preceding influenza season are recommended to receive 2 influenza vaccine doses. Children aged 9-18 years are recommended to receive 1 vaccine dose. To update previous estimates by assessing influenza vaccination coverage among children aged 6 months--18 years during the 2008-09 season, CDC averaged data from the eight immunization information system (IIS) sentinel sites. The results indicated that average (unweighted) vaccination coverage with >or=1 influenza vaccine doses decreased with increasing age from 47.8% for children aged 6-23 months to 9.1% for those aged 13-18 years. Among sites, average coverage with >or=1 doses among children aged 6--23 months increased from 40.8% during the 2007-08 influenza season to 47.8% during the 2008-09 season; however, coverage levels remained suboptimal. Vaccination against both seasonal influenza and 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) are recommended for children in 2009; these findings highlight the need to identify opportunities for and barriers to influenza vaccination of children.},

The first cases were identified on April 28. This report summarizes laboratory-confirmed cases identified during April 24-July 25 and provides clinical and epidemiologic data for a subset of those cases. By July 25, a total of 1,557 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported to CDPH. The overall attack rate was highest among children aged 5-14 years (147 per 100,000 population), which was 14 times higher than for adults aged >or=60 years. A total of 205 (13%) patients were hospitalized, with the highest rate observed among children aged 0-4 years (25 per 100,000), followed by children aged 5-14 years (11 per 100,000). These findings affirm prevention strategies that target children and young adults, who are at a disproportionate risk for infection and hospitalization.

abstract = {We present a metapopulation model of the spread of equine influenza among thoroughbred horses parametrized with data from a 2003 outbreak in Newmarket, UK. The number of horses initially susceptible is derived from a threshold theorem and a published statistical model. Two simulated likelihood-based methods are used to find the within- and between-yard transmissions using both exponential and empirical latent and infectious periods. We demonstrate that the 2003 outbreak was largely locally driven and use the parametrized model to address important questions of control. The chance of a large epidemic is shown to be largely dependent on the size of the index yard. The impact of poor responders to vaccination is estimated under different scenarios. A small proportion of poor responders strongly influences the efficiency of vaccine policies, which increases risk further when the vaccine and infecting strains differ following antigenic drift. Finally, the use of vaccinating in the face of an outbreak is evaluated at a global and individual management group level. The benefits for an individual horse trainer are found to be substantial, although this is influenced by the behaviour of other trainers.},

abstract = {The hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay is the main tool used by epidemiologists to quantify antigenic differences between circulating influenza virus strains, with the goal of selecting suitable vaccine strains. However, such quantitative measures of antigenic difference were recently shown to have poor predictive accuracy with respect to influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in healthy adults. Here, we re-examine those results using a more rigorous criterion for predictive accuracy -- considering only cases when the vaccine (V) and dominant (D) circulating strains are antigenically different -- and greater numbers of HI titers. We find that the Archetti -- Horsfall measure of antigenic difference, which is based on both the normalized HI titer (NHI) of D relative to antisera raised against V and the NHI of V relative to D, predicts VE very well (R(2)=0.62, p=4.1x10(-3)). In contrast, the predictive accuracies of the NHI of D relative to V alone (R(2)=0.01), and two other measures of antigenic difference based on the amino acid sequence of influenza virus hemagglutinin (R(2)=0.03 for both measures) are relatively poor. Furthermore, while VE in the elderly is generally high in cases when D and V are antigenically identical (VE=35%, S.E.=5%), in other cases VE appears to increase with the antigenic difference between D and V (R(2)=0.90, p=2.5x10(-5)). This paradoxical observation could reflect the confounding effects of prior immunity on estimates of VE in the elderly. Together, our results underscore the need for consistently accurate selection of suitable vaccine strains. We suggest directions for further studies aimed at improving vaccine-strain selection and present a large collection of HI titers that will be useful to such studies.},

title = {Coupling hydrologic and infectious disease models to explain regional differences in schistosomiasis transmission in southwestern China},
abstract = {Rainfall-runoff models have become essential tools for conceptualizing and predicting the response of hydrologic processes to changing environments, but they have rarely been applied to challenges facing health scientists. Yet with their efficient parameterization and modest data requirements, they hold great promise for epidemiological application. A modeling analysis incorporating simple hydrologic constraints on transmission of the human parasite Schistosoma japonicum in southwestern China was conducted by coupling a lumped parameter rainfall-runoff model (IHACRES) with a delay-differential equation schistosomiasis transmission model modified to account for channel flows and on-field egg inactivation. Model predictions of prevalence and infection timing agree with observations in the region, which indicate that hydrological differences between sites can lead to pronounced differences in transmission. Channel flows are shown to be important in determining infection intensity and timing in modeled village populations. In the periodic absence of flow, overall transmission intensity is reduced among all modeled risk groups. However, the influence of hydrologic variability was greater on the cercarial stage of the parasite than the miracidial stage, due to the parasite ova's ability to survive dormant on fields between rain events. The predictive power gained from including hydrological data in epidemiological models can improve risk assessments for environmentally mediated diseases, under both long-term climate change scenarios and near-term weather fluctuations.},

abstract = {In the spring of 2009, a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus (swine origin influenza virus [S-OIV]) emerged and began causing a large outbreak of illness in Milwaukee, WI. Our group at the Midwest Respiratory Virus Program laboratory developed a semiautomated real-time multiplex reverse transcription-PCR assay (Seasonal), employing the NucliSENS easyMAG system (bioM{\'e}rieux, Durham, NC) and a Raider thermocycler (HandyLab Inc., Ann Arbor, MI), that typed influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and subtyped influenza A virus into the currently circulating H1 and H3 subtypes, as well as a similar assay that identified H1 of S-OIV. The Seasonal and H1 S-OIV assays demonstrated analytical limits of detection of <50 50% tissue culture infective doses/ml and 3 to 30 input copies, respectively. Testing of the analytical specificities revealed no cross-reactivity with 41 and 26 different common organisms and demonstrated outstanding reproducibility of results. Clinical testing showed 95% sensitivity for influenza A virus and influenza B virus and 95 and 97% specificity compared to tissue culture. Comparisons of results from other molecular tests showed levels of positive agreement with the Seasonal and H1 S-OIV assay results of 99 and 100% and levels of negative agreement of 98 and 100%. This study has demonstrated the use of a semiautomated system for sensitive, specific, and rapid detection of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and RSV and subtyping of influenza A virus into human H1 and H3 and S-OIV strains. This assay/system performed well in clinical testing of regular seasonal influenza virus subtypes and was outstanding during the 2009 Milwaukee S-OIV infection outbreak. This recent outbreak of infection with a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus also demonstrates the importance of quickly distributing information on new agents and of having rapid influenza virus subtyping assays widely available for clinical and public health decisions.},

abstract = {Quantifying long-range dissemination of infectious diseases is a key issue in their dynamics and control. Here, we use influenza-related mortality data to analyze the between-state progression of interpandemic influenza in the United States over the past 30 years. Outbreaks show hierarchical spatial spread evidenced by higher pairwise synchrony between more populous states. Seasons with higher influenza mortality are associated with higher disease transmission and more rapid spread than are mild ones. The regional spread of infection correlates more closely with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces (workflows) than with geographical distance. Workflows are described in turn by a gravity model, with a rapid decay of commuting up to around 100 km and a long tail of rare longer range flow. A simple epidemiological model, based on the gravity formulation, captures the observed increase of influenza spatial synchrony with transmissibility; high transmission allows influenza to spread rapidly beyond local spatial constraints.},

To understand at the molecular level how this new H1N1 virus can be inhibited by the current anti-influenza drugs and which of these drugs it is likely to already be resistant to, homology modeling and MD simulations have been applied on the H1N1 neuraminidase complexed with oseltamivir, and the M2-channel with adamantanes bound. The H1N1 virus was predicted to be susceptible to oseltamivir, with all important interactions with the binding residues being well conserved. In contrast, adamantanes are not predicted to be able to inhibit the M2 function and have completely lost their binding with the M2 residues. This is mainly due to the fact that the M2 transmembrane of the new H1N1 strain contains the S31N mutation which is known to confer resistance to adamantanes.},

title = {Safety and immunogenicity of multiple and higher doses of an inactivated influenza A/H5N1 vaccine},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: H5N1 avian influenza represents an episodic zoonotic disease with the potential to cause a pandemic, and antiviral resistance is of considerable concern. We sought to generate high-titer H5N1 antibodies in healthy volunteers for the purpose of developing hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin. METHODS: We conducted a dose-escalating, unblinded clinical trial involving 75 subjects aged 18-59 years. Three cohorts of twenty-five subjects were enrolled sequentially and received 90, 120, or 180 microg of H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/04 vaccine in 4 doses administered approximately 28 days apart. RESULTS: No statistically significant dose-related increases in the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody were observed when the 90-microg, 120-microg, and 180-microg cohorts were compared. When the cohorts were analyzed together to determine the effect of additional vaccinations, the GMTs of hemagglutination inhibition antibody after the first, second, third, and fourth vaccinations were 1:15.7, 1:22.2, 1:36.0, and 1:32.0, respectively (first vaccination vs. baseline, P<.001; second vs. first vaccination, P=.02; and third vs. second vaccination, P<.001). The microneutralization GMTs after the first, second, third, and fourth vaccinations were 1:17.5, 1:33.1, 1:55.7, and 1:68.4, respectively (P<.001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that a third and fourth dose of the H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/04 vaccine may result in higher hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization GMTs, compared with the GMTs resulting from fewer doses. There was no benefit to increasing the dose of the vaccine. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov identifier: NCT00383071.},

Here, selected 2009 A(H1N1) isolates were assessed for their ability to cause disease in mice and ferrets, and compared with a contemporary seasonal H1N1 virus for their ability to transmit by respiratory droplets to na{\"\i}ve ferrets. In contrast to seasonal influenza H1N1 virus, 2009 A(H1N1) viruses caused increased morbidity, replicated to higher titers in lung tissue, and were recovered from the intestinal tract of intranasally inoculated ferrets. The 2009 A(H1N1) viruses exhibited less efficient respiratory droplet transmission in ferrets in comparison to the high-transmissible phenotype of a seasonal H1N1 virus. Transmission of the 2009 A(H1N1) viruses was further corroborated by characterizing the binding specificity of the viral hemagglutinin to the sialylated glycan receptors (in the human host) using dose-dependent direct receptor binding and human lung tissue binding assays.},

title = {Determinants of hepato- and spleno-megaly in Hunan, China: cross-sectional survey data from areas endemic for schistosomiasis},
abstract = {In order to understand the determinants of schistosome-related hepato- and spleno-megaly better, 14,002 subjects aged 3-60 years (59% male; mean age = 32 years) were randomly selected from 43 villages, all in Hunan province, China, where schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma japonicum is endemic. The abdomen of each subject was examined along the mid-sternal (MSL) and mid-clavicular lines, for evidence of current hepato- and/or spleno-megaly, and a questionnaire was used to collect information on the medical history of each individual. Current infections with S. japonicum were detected by stool examination. Almost all (99.8%) of the subjects were ethnically Han by descent and most (77%) were engaged in farming. Although schistosomiasis appeared common (42% of the subjects claiming to have had the disease), only 45% of the subjects said they had received anti-schistosomiasis drugs. Overall, 1982 (14%) of the subjects had S. japonicum infections (as revealed by miracidium-hatching tests and/or Kato-Katz smears) when examined and 22% had palpable hepatomegaly (i.e. enlargement of at least 3 cm along the MSL), although only 2.5% had any form of detectable splenomegaly (i.e. a Hackett's grade of at least 1). Multiple logistic regression revealed that male subjects, fishermen, farmers, subjects aged > or = 25 years, subjects with a history of schistosomiasis, and subjects who had had bloody stools in the previous 2 weeks were all at relatively high risk of hepato- and/or spleno-megaly. In areas moderately endemic for Schistosoma japonicum, occupational exposure and disease history appear to be good predictors of current disease status among older residents. These results reconfirm those reported earlier in the same region.},

We developed a simple permutation test and its refined version for this purpose. A simulation study shows that the refined permutation test is as powerful as or outcompetes the conventional test built on asymptotic theory, especially when the sample size is small. In addition, our resampling methods can be applied to a broad range of problems where an asymptotic test is not available or fails. We also found that decent statistical power could be attained with just a small number of cases, if the disease is moderately transmissible between humans.},

abstract = {Of the 16 known serotypes of influenza A haemagglutinin, 6 have been isolated from humans at the molecular level (H1, H2, H3, H5, H7, H9). 3 of these have been involved in past pandemics (H1, H2, H3). Traditional pandemic surveillance has focussed on monitoring antigenic shift, meaning the re-assortment of novel haemagglutinins into seasonal human influenza A viruses during rare events of double infection with seasonal and zoonotic strains. H5, from avian H5N1 influenza, has been the major cause for concern in recent years. However, the 2009 H1N1 zoonotic event demonstrates that even serotypes already encountered in past human pandemics may constitute new pandemic threats. The protein sequence divergence of the 2009 zoonotic H1 from human seasonal influenza H1 is around 20-24%. A similar level of divergence is found between the 2009 H1 and European swine flu. By contrast, its divergence from North American swine flu strains is around 1-9%. Given that the divergence between H1 and its nearest serotype neighbour H2 is around 40-46%, the 2009 H1 may be broadly considered as halfway towards a new serotype. The current situation is one of antigenic pseudo-shift.},

title = {A novel, colorimetric neutralization assay for measuring antibodies to influenza viruses},
abstract = {A colorimetric cell proliferation assay for measuring neutralizing antibodies to influenza viruses in human sera is described. Following a 90-min incubation, the serum-virus mixture was transferred to Madin-Darby canine kidney cells cultured in 96-well plates. After further incubation for three days, a tetrazolium salt was added to the wells. Cellular mitochondrial dehydrogenases cleave the tetrazolium salt to formazan, and the resulting color change is read by a spectrophotometer. The absorbance values correlate directly to the number of viable cells in the assay well and thus also to the neutralizing activity of influenza-specific antibodies present in the serum. With the few hands-on manipulations required, this assay allows simultaneous testing of a considerable number of sera, offers opportunities for automation, and is suitable for use under biosafety level-3 conditions. The test was used to study the antibody response after the administration of seasonal, inactivated, trivalent influenza vaccine. Antibody titers determined by the neutralization test in pre- and post-vaccination serum pairs were compared with those obtained by the hemagglutination inhibition assay. The neutralization test yielded higher pre- and post-vaccination titers and a larger number of significant increases in post-vaccination antibody titer than the hemagglutination inhibition test. This new test format could serve as a valuable laboratory tool for influenza vaccine studies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To predict the spatial distributions of Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni infections to assist planning the implementation of mass distribution of praziquantel as part of an on-going national control programme in Tanzania. METHODS: Bayesian geostatistical models were developed using parasitological data from 143 schools. RESULTS: In the S. haematobium models, although land surface temperature and rainfall were significant predictors of prevalence, they became non-significant when spatial correlation was taken into account. In the S. mansoni models, distance to water bodies and annual minimum temperature were significant predictors, even when adjusting for spatial correlation. Spatial correlation occurred over greater distances for S. haematobium than for S. mansoni. Uncertainties in predictions were examined to identify areas requiring further data collection before programme implementation. CONCLUSION: Bayesian geostatistical analysis is a powerful and statistically robust tool for identifying high prevalence areas in a heterogeneous and imperfectly known environment.},

abstract = {Background. Immunization remains the best prevention strategy for influenza, but production constraints for egg-based influenza vaccines have prompted the development of innovative cell culture manufacturing processes. Here, we describe a novel cell culture-derived influenza vaccine (CCIV) produced in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Methods. This phase 3, observer-blind, randomized, multicenter study in Poland compared the immunogenicity of a CCIV and a conventional egg-based vaccine. Participants, stratified by age (adults 18-60 years, [Formula: see text]; elderly persons 61 years, [Formula: see text]), received a single intramuscular vaccination. Immunogenicity was assessed 21 days later by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Reactogenicity was assessed using self-completed diary cards. Results. The immunogenicity of CCIV was noninferior to that of the conventional vaccine for all 3 vaccine strains in both age groups, regardless of underlying health status. Both vaccines fulfilled European Union registration criteria and were well tolerated, with similar incidences of solicited local and systemic reactions in both age groups; the only significant difference was an increased frequency of mild or moderate pain with CCIV than the conventional vaccine among adult (22% vs 17%; [Formula: see text]) and elderly (9% vs 5%; [Formula: see text]) vaccinees. Conclusions. CCIV was well tolerated and highly immunogenic in adults 18 years of age or older. Cell culture may offer greater flexibility of supply during periods of high demand for both seasonal and pandemic vaccines. Trial registration. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00492063 .},

title = {SI: Mitigation strategies for pandemic influenza in the United States},
abstract = {Recent human deaths due to infection by highly pathogenic (H5N1) avian influenza A virus have raised the specter of a devastating pandemic like that of 1917-1918, should this avian virus evolve to become readily transmissible among humans. We introduce and use a large-scale stochastic simulation model to investigate the spread of a pandemic strain of influenza virus through the U.S. population of 281 million individuals for R(0) (the basic reproductive number) from 1.6 to 2.4. We model the impact that a variety of levels and combinations of influenza antiviral agents, vaccines, and modified social mobility (including school closure and travel restrictions) have on the timing and magnitude of this spread. Our simulations demonstrate that, in a highly mobile population, restricting travel after an outbreak is detected is likely to delay slightly the time course of the outbreak without impacting the eventual number ill. For R(0) < 1.9, our model suggests that the rapid production and distribution of vaccines, even if poorly matched to circulating strains, could significantly slow disease spread and limit the number ill to <10% of the population, particularly if children are preferentially vaccinated. Alternatively, the aggressive deployment of several million courses of influenza antiviral agents in a targeted prophylaxis strategy may contain a nascent outbreak with low R(0), provided adequate contact tracing and distribution capacities exist. For higher R(0), we predict that multiple strategies in combination (involving both social and medical interventions) will be required to achieve similar limits on illness rates.},

We tested the sensitivity of model predictions to key epidemiological parameters before choosing three representative scenarios from within the range explored. We examined the spatiotemporal dynamics for these illustrative scenarios and assessed the efficacy of symptomatic case isolation, contact tracing with vaccination, and reactive regional mass vaccination as policy options for control. We conclude that case isolation and contact tracing with vaccination would be sufficient to halt ongoing transmission rapidly, unless policy effectiveness was compromised by resource or other constraints. A slight reduction in the expected size and duration of an outbreak could be achieved with regional mass vaccination, but these benefits are small and do not justify the high numbers of vaccine doses required and their associated negative side effects.},

We describe the first 11 weeks of sentinel surveillance in 2009 (weeks 18-28), during which time pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus became established, and investigate the protective effect of seasonal influenza vaccine against laboratory-confirmed infection caused by the pandemic virus. At the time of reporting, the peak ILI activity in 2009 had been reached and was similar to the peak recorded in 2007 but below the peak of 2003. The proportion of cases positive for any influenza virus increased from 6% in the first week of surveillance (week 18) to 59% by week 28, during which time the proportion of influenza viruses detected as pandemic influenza increased from zero to 95%, with at least 91% of all influenza viruses confirmed as pandemic influenza by the eighth week of surveillance (week 25). The median age of all 223 patients with pandemic influenza for whom age was known was 21 years (range 2-63 years) compared with the median age of 53 patients with seasonal H1N1 influenza in 2007 or 2008 of 23 years (range 1-75 years). There was no evidence of significant protection from seasonal vaccine against pandemic influenza virus infection in any age group.},

title = {The critical vaccination fraction for heterogeneous epidemic models},
abstract = {Given a population with m heterogeneous subgroups, a method is developed for determining minimal vaccine allocations to prevent an epidemic by setting the reproduction number to 1. The framework is sufficiently general to apply to several epidemic situations, such as SIR, SEIR and SIS models with vital dynamics. The reproduction number is the largest eigenvalue of the linearized system round the local point of equilibrium of the model. Using the Perron-Frobenius theorem, an exact method for generating solutions is given and the threshold surface of critical vaccine allocations is shown to be a compact, connected subset of a regular (m-1)-dimensional manifold. Populations with two subgroups are examined in full. The threshold curves are either hyperbolas or straight lines. Explicit conditions are given as to when threshold elimination is achievable by vaccinating just one or two groups in a multi-group population and expressions for the critical coverage are derived. Specific reference is made to an influenza A model. Separable or proportionate mixing is also treated. Conditions are conjectured for convexity of the threshold surface and the problem of minimizing the amount of vaccine used while remaining on the threshold surface is discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the spring of 2009, a pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged and spread globally. We describe the clinical characteristics of the patients who were hospitalized with 2009 H1N1 influenza in the United States from April 2009 to mid-June 2009. METHODS: Using medical charts, we collected data on 272 patients who were hospitalized for at least 24 hours for influenza-like illness and who tested positive for the 2009 H1N1 virus with the use of a real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay. RESULTS: Of the 272 patients we studied, 25% were admitted to an intensive care unit and 7% died. Forty-five percent of the patients were children under the age of 18 years, and 5% were 65 years of age or older. Seventy-three percent of the patients had at least one underlying medical condition; these conditions included asthma; diabetes; heart, lung, and neurologic diseases; and pregnancy. Of the 249 patients who underwent chest radiography on admission, 100 (40%) had findings consistent with pneumonia. Of the 268 patients for whom data were available regarding the use of antiviral drugs, such therapy was initiated in 200 patients (75%) at a median of 3 days after the onset of illness. Data suggest that the use of antiviral drugs was beneficial in hospitalized patients, especially when such therapy was initiated early. CONCLUSIONS: During the evaluation period, 2009 H1N1 influenza caused severe illness requiring hospitalization, including pneumonia and death. Nearly three quarters of the patients had one or more underlying medical conditions. Few severe illnesses were reported among persons 65 years of age or older. Patients seemed to benefit from antiviral therapy. Copyright 2009 Massachusetts Medical Society.},

title = {Estimation of the efficacy of live, attenuated influenza vaccine from a two-year, multi-center vaccine trial: implications for influenza epidemic control},
abstract = {The authors provide an analysis of data from a two-year (1996-1998), multicenter (ten US cities), double-blinded, placebo-controlled influenza vaccine trial in children. The vaccine was the trivalent cold-adapted influenza vaccine. Estimates are made of the vaccine efficacy for susceptibility to culture-confirmed influenza (VE(S)) while taking inter-center variability in the risk of infection into account. Our overall estimate of VE(S) against influenza is 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89-0.94). In addition, for the second year, although the vaccine contained antigen for A/Wuhan-like (H3N2), the estimated VE(S) for epidemic variant A/Sydney-like (H3N2) was 0.89 (95% CI 0.81-0.94). Thus, the vaccine showed a high degree of protection against a variant not closely matched to the vaccine antigen. With regard to natural immunity, an influenza A infection in the first year reduces the estimated risk of an influenza A infection in the second year by a factor of 0.88 (95% CI 0.21-0.98). When comparing year 1 to year 2, there is a negative correlation of -0.50 in the center-specific attack rates in the placebo groups. This is consistent with the theory that natural immunity provides overall community protection to children. The authors argue that mass vaccination of 70% of the children with the cold-adapted influenza vaccine could provide substantial protection to the community at large.},

abstract = {Medical interventions like vaccination and antiviral prophylaxis are only two ways of protecting the population from infectious diseases. A third and decisive method is to apply non-pharmaceutical interventions like hand hygiene. A qualitative study identified the role hand washing actually plays in the daily life of the population. Based on the results, seven hypotheses are proposed which point to the need for further research about promotion of hand hygiene, e.g. the conception and evaluation of hand washing advertising campaigns. HYPOTHESIS 1: Health tips are more likely to be followed if they communicate clearly and understandably the personal relevance of the information to the recipients. HYPOTHESIS 2: For many, hygiene serves above all to make them feel good and more comfortable around others. HYPOTHESIS 3: The feeling of disgust is an emotional connection between health and hygiene. HYPOTHESIS 4: People mainly wash their hands ritually and when they actually feel the need to clean their hands. HYPOTHESIS 5: As far as most people are aware, the means of transmission of influenza and other respiratory diseases are only the ones they can observe, namely coughing, sneezing, and the resulting visible droplets. HYPOTHESIS 6: People are more motivated to wash their hands after learning that infections can be spread via the hands. HYPOTHESIS 7: A pandemic situation increases the population's demand for information and people's willingness to protect themselves from infection.},

abstract = {We present a stochastic model of the within-host population dynamics of lymphatic filariasis, and use a simulated goodness-of-fit (GOF) method to estimate immunological parameters and their confidence intervals from experimental data. A variety of deterministic moment closure approximations to the stochastic system are explored and compared with simulation results. For the maximum GOF parameter estimates, none of the methods of closure accurately reproduce the behaviour of the stochastic model. However, direct analysis of the stochastic model demonstrates that the high levels of variation observed in the data can be reproduced without requiring parameters to vary between hosts. This indicates that the observed aggregation of parasite load may be dynamically generated by random variation in the development of an effective immune response against parasite larvae.

title = {Is mass treatment the appropriate schistosomiasis elimination strategy?},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In the year 2000, the Philippines' Department of Health adopted mass chemotherapy using praziquantel to eliminate schistosomiasis. Mass treatment was offered to an eligible population of 30 187 residents of 50 villages in Western Samar, the Philippines, in 2004 as part of an ongoing epidemiological study, Schistosomiasis Transmission and Ecology in the Philippines (STEP), aimed at measuring the effect of irrigation on infection with schistosomiasis. This paper describes the mass-treatment activities and factors associated with participation. METHODS: Advocacy, information dissemination and social mobilization activities were conducted before mass chemotherapy. Village leaders were primarily responsible for community mobilization. Mass treatment was offered in village meeting halls and schools. Participation proportions were estimated based on the 2002-2003 census. Community involvement was measured using a participation index. A Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression model was fitted to estimate the association between sociodemographic factors and residents coming to the treatment site. FINDINGS: A village-level average of 53.1% of residents (range: 21.1-85.3) came to the treatment site, leading to a mass-treatment coverage with an average of 48.3% (range: 15.8-80.7). At the individual level, participation proportions were higher among males, preschool and school-age children, non-STEP participants and among those who provided a stool sample. At the village-level, better community involvement was associated with increased participation whereas a larger census was associated with decreased participation. CONCLUSION: The conduct of mass treatment in the 50 villages resulted in far lower participation than expected. This raises concern for the ongoing mass-treatment initiatives now taking place in developing countries.},

title = {Large-scale spatial-transmission models of infectious disease},
abstract = {During transmission of seasonal endemic diseases such as measles and influenza, spatial waves of infection have been observed between large distant populations. Also, during the initial stages of an outbreak of a new or reemerging pathogen, disease incidence tends to occur in spatial clusters, which makes containment possible if you can predict the subsequent spread of disease. Spatial models are being used with increasing frequency to help characterize these large-scale patterns and to evaluate the impact of interventions. Here, I review several recent studies on four diseases that show the benefits of different methodologies: measles (patch models), foot-and-mouth disease (distance-transmission models), pandemic influenza (multigroup models), and smallpox (network models). This review highlights the importance of the household in spatial studies of human diseases, such as smallpox and influenza. It also demonstrates the need to develop a simple model of household demographics, so that these large-scale models can be extended to the investigation of long-time scale human pathogens, such as tuberculosis and HIV.},

title = {Evolution and molecular epidemiology of H9N2 influenza A viruses from quail in southern China, 2000 to 2005},
abstract = {H9N2 influenza viruses have become established and maintain long-term endemicity in terrestrial poultry in Asian countries. Occasionally these viruses transmit to other mammals, including humans. Increasing epidemiological and laboratory findings suggest that quail may be an important host, as they are susceptible to different subtypes of influenza viruses. To better understand the role of quail in influenza virus ecology and evolution, H9N2 viruses isolated from quail during 2000 to 2005 were antigenically and genetically characterized. Our results showed that H9N2 viruses are prevalent year-round in southern China and replicate mainly asymptomatically in the respiratory tract of quail. Genetic analysis revealed that both the G1-like and Ck/Bei-like H9N2 lineages were cocirculating in quail since 2000. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that most of the isolates tested were double- or multiple-reassortant variants, with four G1-like and 16 Ck/Bei-like genotypes recognized. A novel genotype of G1-like virus became predominant in quail since 2003, while multiple Ck/Bei-like genotypes were introduced into quail, wherein they incorporated G1-like gene segments, but none of them became established in this host. Those Ck/Bei-like reassortants generated in quail have then been introduced into other poultry. These complex interactions form a two-way transmission system between quail and other types of poultry. The present study provides evidence that H9N2 and H5N1 subtype viruses have also exchanged gene segments to generate currently circulating reassortants of both subtypes that have pandemic potential. Continuing influenza virus surveillance in poultry is critical to understanding the genesis and emergence of potentially pandemic strains in this region.},

title = {SARS outbreaks in Ontario, Hong Kong and Singapore: the role of diagnosis and isolation as a control mechanism},
abstract = {In this article we use global and regional data from the SARS epidemic in conjunction with a model of susceptible, exposed, infective, diagnosed, and recovered classes of people ("SEIJR") to extract average properties and rate constants for those populations. The model is fitted to data from the Ontario (Toronto) in Canada, Hong Kong in China and Singapore outbreaks and predictions are made based on various assumptions and observations, including the current effect of isolating individuals diagnosed with SARS. The epidemic dynamics for Hong Kong and Singapore appear to be different from the dynamics in Toronto, Ontario. Toronto shows a very rapid increase in the number of cases between March 31st and April 6th, followed by a significant slowing in the number of new cases. We explain this as the result of an increase in the diagnostic rate and in the effectiveness of patient isolation after March 26th. Our best estimates are consistent with SARS eventually being contained in Toronto, although the time of containment is sensitive to the parameters in our model. It is shown that despite the empirically modeled heterogeneity in transmission, SARS' average reproductive number is 1.2, a value quite similar to that computed for some strains of influenza (J. Math. Biol. 27 (1989) 233). Although it would not be surprising to see levels of SARS infection higher than 10% in some regions of the world (if unchecked), lack of data and the observed heterogeneity and sensitivity of parameters prevent us from predicting the long-term impact of SARS. The possibility that 10 or more percent of the world population at risk could eventually be infected with the virus in conjunction with a mortality rate of 3-7% or more, and indications of significant improvement in Toronto support the stringent measures that have been taken to isolate diagnosed cases.},

title = {A cross-sectional study of the prevalence of intensity of infection with Schistosoma japonicum in 50 irrigated and rain-fed villages in Samar Province, the Philippines},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have described heterogeneity in Schistosoma japonicum infection intensity, and none were done in Philippines. The purpose of this report is to describe the village-to-village variation in the prevalence of two levels of infection intensity across 50 villages of Samar Province, the Philippines. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 25 rain-fed and 25 irrigated villages endemic for S. japonicum between August 2003 and November 2004. Villages were selected based on irrigation and farming criteria. A maximum of 35 eligible households were selected per village. Each participant was asked to provide stool samples on three consecutive days. All those who provided at least one stool sample were included in the analysis. A Bayesian three category outcome hierarchical cumulative logit regression model with adjustment for age, sex, occupation and measurement error of the Kato-Katz technique was used for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1427 households and 6917 individuals agreed to participate in the study. A total of 5624 (81.3%) participants provided at least one stool sample. The prevalences of those lightly and at least moderately infected varied from 0% (95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 0%-3.1%) to 45.2% (95% BCI: 36.5%-53.9%) and 0% to 23.0% (95% BCI: 16.4%-31.2%) from village-to-village, respectively. Using the 0-7 year old group as a reference category, the highest odds ratio (OR) among males and females were that of being aged 17-40-year old (OR = 8.76; 95% BCI: 6.03-12.47) and 11-16-year old (OR = 8.59; 95% BCI: 4.74-14.28), respectively. People who did not work on a rice farm had a lower prevalence of infection than those working full time on a rice farm. The OR for irrigated villages compared to rain-fed villages was 1.41 (95% BCI: 0.50-3.21). DISCUSSION: We found very important village-to-village variation in prevalence of infection intensity. This variation is probably due to village-level variables other than that explained by a crude classification of villages into the irrigated and non-irrigated categories. We are planning to capture this spatial heterogeneity by updating our initial transmission dynamics model with the data reported here combined with 1-year post-treatment follow-up of study participants.},

abstract = {Non-availability of adult worms from living hosts remains a key problem in population genetic studies of schistosomes. Indirect sampling involving passage through laboratory animals presents significant ethical and practical drawbacks, and may result in sampling biases such as bottlenecking processes and/or host-induced selection pressures. The novel techniques reported here for sampling, storage and multi-locus microsatellite analysis of larval Schistosoma mansoni, allowing genotyping of up to 7 microsatellite loci from a single larva, circumvent these problems. The utility of these assays and the potential problems of laboratory passage, were evaluated using 7 S. mansoni population isolates collected from school-children in the Hoima district of Uganda, by comparing the associated field-collected miracidia with adult worms and miracidia obtained from a single generation in laboratory mice. Analyses of laboratory-passaged material erroneously indicated the presence of geographical structuring in the population, emphasizing the dangers of indirect sampling for population genetic studies. Bottlenecking and/or other sampling effects were demonstrated by reduced variability of adult worms compared to their parent field-collected larval samples. Patterns of heterozygote deficiency were apparent in the field-collected samples, which were not evident in laboratory-derived samples, potentially indicative of heterozygote advantage in establishment within laboratory hosts. Genetic distance between life-cycle stages in the majority of isolates revealed that adult worms and laboratory-passaged miracidia clustered together whilst segregating from field miracidia, thereby further highlighting the utility of this assay.},

We undertook a drug intervention to test the hypothesis that buffalo are major reservoirs for human infection in the marshlands/lake areas, where one million people are infected. We compared human and buffalo infection rates and intensity in an intervention village (Jishan), where humans and buffalo were treated with praziquantel, and a control village (Hexi), where only humans were treated, in the Poyang Lake region. Over the four-year study, human incidence in Jishan decreased but increased in Hexi. Adjustment of incidence by age, sex, water exposure, year, and village further confirmed the decreased human infection in Jishan. Chemotherapy for buffaloes resulted in a decrease in buffalo infection rates in Jishan, which coincided with the reduction in human infection rates there in the last two years of the study. Mathematical modeling predicted that buffalo are responsible for 75% of human transmission in Jishan.},

title = {An augmented data method for the analysis of nosocomial infection data},
abstract = {The analysis of nosocomial infection data for communicable pathogens is  complicated by two facts. First, typical pathogens more commonly cause  asymptomatic colonization than overt disease, so transmission can be  only imperfectly observed through a sequence of surveillance swabs,  which themselves have imperfect sensitivity. Any given set of swab  results can therefore be consistent with many different patterns of  transmission. Second, data are often highly dependent: the colonization  status of one patient affects the risk for others, and, in some wards,  repeated admissions are common. Here, the authors present a method for  analyzing typical nosocomial infection data consisting of results from  arbitrarily timed screening swabs that overcomes these problems and  enables simultaneous estimation of transmission and importation  parameters, duration of colonization, swab sensitivity, and ward- and  patient-level covariates. The method accounts for dependencies by using  a mechanistic stochastic transmission model, and it allows for  uncertainty in the data by imputing the imperfectly observed  colonization status of patients over repeated admissions. The approach  uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing inference within a  Bayesian framework. The method is applied to illustrative data from an  interrupted time-series study of vancomycin-resistant enterococci  transmission in a hematology ward.},

title = {Evaluation of rapid influenza diagnostic tests for detection of novel influenza A (H1N1) Virus - United States, 2009},
abstract = {The recent appearance and worldwide spread of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus has highlighted the need to evaluate commercially available, widely used, rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) for their ability to detect these viral antigens in respiratory clinical specimens. As an initial assessment, CDC conducted an evaluation of multiple RIDTs. Sixty-five clinical respiratory specimens collected during April-May 2009 that had previously tested positive either for novel influenza A (H1N1) or for seasonal influenza A (H1N1) or A (H3N2) viruses by real-time reverse transcription--polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay were used in the evaluation. The results showed that, although the RIDTs were capable of detecting novel A (H1N1) virus from respiratory specimens containing high levels of virus (as indicated by low cycle threshold [Ct] values), the overall sensitivity was low (40%-69%) among all specimens tested and declined substantially as virus levels decreased (and Ct values increased). These findings indicate that, although a positive RIDT result can be used in making treatment decisions, a negative result does not rule out infection with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus. Patients with illnesses compatible with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection but with negative RIDT results should be treated empirically based on the level of clinical suspicion, underlying medical conditions, severity of illness, and risk for complications. If a more definitive determination of infection with influenza virus is required, testing with rRT-PCR or virus isolation should be performed. Additional evaluations of the accuracy of RIDTs in detecting novel influenza A (H1N1) virus should be conducted.},

title = {Differential neutralization efficiency of hemagglutinin epitopes, antibody interference, and the design of influenza vaccines},
abstract = {It is generally assumed that amino acid mutations in the surface protein, hemagglutinin (HA), of influenza viruses allow these viruses to circumvent neutralization by antibodies induced during infection. However, empirical data on circulating influenza viruses show that certain amino acid changes to HA actually increase the efficiency of neutralization of the mutated virus by antibodies raised against the parent virus. Here, we suggest that this surprising increase in neutralization efficiency after HA mutation could reflect steric interference between antibodies. Specifically, if there is a steric competition for binding to HA by antibodies with different neutralization efficiencies, then a mutation that reduces the binding of antibodies with low neutralization efficiencies could increase overall viral neutralization. We use a mathematical model of virus-antibody interaction to elucidate the conditions under which amino acid mutations to HA could lead to an increase in viral neutralization. Using insights gained from the model, together with genetic and structural data, we predict that amino acid mutations to epitopes C and E of the HA of influenza A/H3N2 viruses could lead on average to an increase in the neutralization of the mutated viruses. We present data supporting this prediction and discuss the implications for the design of more effective vaccines against influenza viruses and other pathogens.},

abstract = {Limited amount of information is available in Taiwan on the genetic or antigenic characteristics of influenza A virus prior to the establishment of a Taiwan surveillance network in 2000. Isolates of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in Taiwan between 1980 and 2006 were studied, and part of the hemagglutinin gene was analyzed due to its importance in terms of viral infection and antibody neutralization. Results from a phylogenetic analysis indicate continuous evolutionary topology in H3N2 isolates, and two distinct H1N1 lineages. Many genetic relationships between vaccine strains and epidemic isolates appearing in Taiwan before other global locations were also observed and recorded in addition to a gradual increase in the number of N-linked glycosylation sites on partial HA1 proteins since 1980. The results from pairwise comparisons of HA1 nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences indicate shared identities within groups organized according to their bootstrap and P-values of approximately 95.5-100% and 95.7-100% in H1N1 and 94.5-100% and 93.2-100% in H3N2 viruses, respectively. Comparisons of amino acid substitutions in the five antigenic regions reveal highly non-synonymous changes occurring in the Sb region of H1N1 and in the B region of H3N2. The results of an antigenic analysis using a hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) test indicate the presence of some epidemic strains 1-2 years earlier in Taiwan than in other parts of the world, as well as higher vaccine mismatch rates. This information supports the need for continuous surveillance of emerging influenza viruses in Taiwan, which will be useful for making global vaccine decisions.},

There are, however, many different epidemics within the global pandemic of HIV, each with its own dynamics and each influenced by many factors, including the time of introduction of the virus, population density, and cultural and social issues.  Effective management strategies depend upon knowledge of all these factors.  By the year 2000, the World Health Organization projects that 26 million people will be infected with HIV, more than 90% of whom will be in developing countries.  The author stresses that to control AIDS, countries must not only promote changes in individual behavior, but also address social issues such as unemployment, rapid urbanization, migration, and women's status.  This paper describes the epidemiological features of the HIV pandemic, including its evolution, economic and demographic impacts, unique characteristics in different regions of the world, and projections for the next four years.},

We characterized the population structure of the multi-host parasite Schistosoma japonicum in relation to its definitive host species by genotyping miracidia collected from humans and domestic animals across five villages around the Yangtze River in Anhui Province, mainland China, using microsatellite markers. High levels of polymorphisms were observed and two main genetic clusters were identified which separated water buffalo, cattle and humans from goats, pigs, dogs and cats. We thereby believe that we present the first evidence of definitive host-based genetic variation in Schistosoma japonicum which has important epidemiological, evolutionary, medical and veterinary implications.},

abstract = {It is useful to have a disaggregated population database at uniform grid units in disaster situations. This study presents a method for settlement location probability and population density estimations at a 90m resolution for northern Iraq using the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) digital terrain model and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. A spatial model each for calculating the probability of settlement location and for estimating population density is described. A randomly selected subset of field data (equivalent to 50%) is first analysed for statistical links between settlement location probability and population density; and various biophysical features which are extracted from Landsat or SRTM data. The model is calibrated using this subset. Settlement location probability is attributed to the distance from roads and water bodies and land cover. Population density can be estimated based upon land cover and topographic features. The Landsat data are processed using a segmentation and subsequent feature-based classification approach making this method robust to seasonal variations in imagery and therefore applicable to a time series of images regardless of acquisition date. The second half of the field data is used to validate the model. Results show a reasonable estimate of population numbers (r=0.205, p<0.001) for both rural and urban settlements. Although there is a strong overall correlation between the results of this and the LandScan model (r=0.464, p<0.001), this method performs better than the 1km resolution LandScan grid for settlements with fewer than 1000 people, but is less accurate for estimating population numbers in urban areas (LandScan rural r=0.181, p<0.001; LandScan urban r=0.303, p<0.001). The correlation between true urban population numbers is superior to that of LandScan however when the 90m grid values are summed using a filter which corresponds to the LandScan spatial resolution (r=0.318, p<0.001).},

title = {Neutralizing antibodies derived from the B cells of 1918 influenza pandemic survivors},
abstract = {Investigation of the human antibody response to influenza virus infection has been largely limited to serology, with relatively little analysis at the molecular level. The 1918 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic was the most severe of the modern era. Recent work has recovered the gene sequences of this unusual strain, so that the 1918 pandemic virus could be reconstituted to display its unique virulence phenotypes. However, little is known about adaptive immunity to this virus. We took advantage of the 1918 virus sequencing and the resultant production of recombinant 1918 haemagglutinin (HA) protein antigen to characterize at the clonal level neutralizing antibodies induced by natural exposure of survivors to the 1918 pandemic virus. Here we show that of the 32 individuals tested that were born in or before 1915, each showed seroreactivity with the 1918 virus, nearly 90 years after the pandemic. Seven of the eight donor samples tested had circulating B cells that secreted antibodies that bound the 1918 HA. We isolated B cells from subjects and generated five monoclonal antibodies that showed potent neutralizing activity against 1918 virus from three separate donors. These antibodies also cross-reacted with the genetically similar HA of a 1930 swine H1N1 influenza strain, but did not cross-react with HAs of more contemporary human influenza viruses. The antibody genes had an unusually high degree of somatic mutation. The antibodies bound to the 1918 HA protein with high affinity, had exceptional virus-neutralizing potency and protected mice from lethal infection. Isolation of viruses that escaped inhibition suggested that the antibodies recognize classical antigenic sites on the HA surface. Thus, these studies demonstrate that survivors of the 1918 influenza pandemic possess highly functional, virus-neutralizing antibodies to this uniquely virulent virus, and that humans can sustain circulating B memory cells to viruses for many decades after exposure-well into the tenth decade of life.},

title = {Field evaluation of the Meade Readiview handheld microscope for diagnosis of intestinal schistosomiasis in Ugandan school children},
abstract = {A novel, inexpensive handheld microscope, the Meade Readiview, was evaluated for field diagnosis of intestinal schistosomiasis by comparison of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) against conventional compound microscopy as part of a parasitologic survey in nine sentinel schools and a rapid mapping survey across 22 schools in Uganda. Fecal smears from 685 primary school children were examined and the overall prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni was 45%. However, prevalence by school ranged widely from 0% to 100%. For individual diagnosis the Readiview had a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 96%, a PPV of 95%, and an NPV of 88%. Due to the poorer movement control of the glass slide on the Readiview stage, fecal smears with less than four eggs could be overlooked. At the highest magnification (160x), egg-like objects could be confounding. Estimating prevalence by school was usually within +/- 7% of that of conventional microscopy. Since the Readiview is more robust and portable, both in size and weight, and one-tenth as expensive as the traditional compound microscope, a change in the logistics and costs associated with field infection surveillance is possible. This inexpensive microscope is a pragmatic alternative to the compound microscope. It could play an important role in the collection of prevalence data to better guide anthelmintic drug delivery and also empower the diagnostic capacity of peripheral health centers where compound microscopes are few or absent.},

abstract = {Wild waterfowl, including ducks, are natural hosts of influenza A viruses. These viruses rarely caused disease in ducks until 2002, when some H5N1 strains became highly pathogenic. Here we show that these H5N1 viruses are reverting to nonpathogenicity in ducks. Ducks experimentally infected with viruses isolated between 2003 and 2004 shed virus for an extended time (up to 17 days), during which variant viruses with low pathogenicity were selected. These results suggest that the duck has become the "Trojan horse" of Asian H5N1 influenza viruses. The ducks that are unaffected by infection with these viruses continue to circulate these viruses, presenting a pandemic threat.},

title = {Inhaled zanamivir for the prevention of influenza in families. Zanamivir Family Study Group},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: As prophylaxis against influenza in families, amantadine and rimantadine have had inconsistent effectiveness, partly because of the transmission of drug-resistant variants from treated index patients. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of inhaled zanamivir for the treatment and prevention of influenza in families. METHODS: We enrolled families (with two to five members and at least one child who was five years of age or older) before the 1998-1999 influenza season. If an influenza-like illness developed in one member, the family was randomly assigned to receive either inhaled zanamivir or placebo. The family member with the index illness was treated with either 10 mg of inhaled zanamivir (163 subjects) or placebo (158) twice a day for 5 days, and the other family members received either 10 mg of zanamivir (414 subjects) or placebo (423) once a day as prophylaxis for 10 days. The primary end point was the proportion of families in which at least one household contact had symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed influenza. RESULTS: The proportion of families with at least one initially healthy household contact in whom influenza developed was smaller in the zanamivir group than in the placebo group (4 percent vs. 19 percent, P<0.001); the difference represented a 79 percent reduction in the proportion of families with at least one affected contact. Zanamivir provided protection against both influenza A and influenza B. A neuraminidase-inhibition assay and sequencing of the neuraminidase and hemagglutinin genes revealed no zanamivir-resistant variants. Among the subjects with index cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza, the median duration of symptoms was 2.5 days shorter in the zanamivir group than in the placebo group (5.0 vs. 7.5 days, P=0.01). Zanamivir was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: When combined with the treatment of index cases, prophylactic treatment of family members with once-daily inhaled zanamivir is well tolerated and prevents the development of influenza. In this study there was no evidence of the emergence of resistant influenza variants.},

title = {Schistosoma japonicum infection in the pig as a model for human schistosomiasis japonica},
abstract = {Valuable information on human schistosomiasis japonica has been provided using primates and experimental rodent hosts. However, major drawbacks such as high costs and ethical concerns for the primate models and large biological deviations for the rodent models have led to the search for more appropriate models. Recent data on the pig indicate that this natural host for Schistosoma japonicum might be a realistic alternative. As only very few research groups have investigated the S. japonicum/pig model, the present review mainly deals with the experimental methods and the major host/parasite findings obtained from the authors own research group. With emphasis on a critical evaluation of the work, the results are compared to the scarce information existing on human schistosomiasis japonica. Like in humans, S. japonicum establishes mainly in the large intestinal veins, with high faecal egg counts during the acute phase of infection, which varies greatly within and between days. Concomitant resistance is another shared feature, but studies in pigs have indicated that the phenomenon is more complex than generally thought. Clinical signs as eosinophilia and diarrhoea with mucus and blood in the acute phase of infection and hepatomegaly, increased portal diameter, periportal fibrosis and ascites in chronic infections are common findings in both humans and pigs. Low protein diet aggravates the disease in pigs by increasing the establishment rates, the faecal egg excretion and the morbidity. A 100% cure rate is achieved when treating S. japonicum infected pigs with praziquantel at 40 mg/kg, and 4 weeks post treatment pigs remain resistant to reinfection. Lastly, human congenital S. japonicum infection has been confirmed in pigs but the implications of such infections for the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis japonica remain to be investigated.},

abstract = {The availability of immunogenic, licensed H5N1 vaccines and the anticipated development of vaccines against "swine" influenza A(H1N1) have stimulated debate about the possible use of these vaccines for protection of those exposed to potential pandemic influenza viruses and for immunization or "priming" of populations in the so-called "prepandemic" (interpandemic) era. However, the safety of such vaccines is a critical issue in policy development for wide-scale application of vaccines in the interpandemic period. For example, wide-scale interpandemic use of H5N1 vaccines could lead to millions of persons receiving vaccines of uncertain efficacy potentially associated with rare severe adverse events and against a virus that may not cause a pandemic. Here, we first review aspects of the 1976 National Influenza Immunization Programme against "swine flu" and its well-documented association with Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome as a case study illustration of a suspected vaccine-associated severe adverse event in a mass interpandemic immunization setting. This case study is especially timely, given the recent spread of a novel influenza A(H1N1) virus in humans in Mexico and beyond. Following this, we examine available safety data from clinical trials of H5N1 vaccines and briefly discuss how vaccine safety could be monitored in a postmarketing surveillance setting.},

abstract = {Influenza virus evades prevailing natural and vaccine-induced immunity by accumulating antigenic change in the haemagglutinin surface protein. Linking amino acid substitutions in haemagglutinin epitopes to epidemiology has been problematic because of the scarcity of data connecting these scales. We use experiments on equine influenza virus to address this issue, quantifying how key parameters of viral establishment and shedding increase the probability of transmission with genetic distance between previously immunizing virus and challenge virus. Qualitatively similar patterns emerge from analyses based on antigenic distance and from a published human influenza study. Combination of the equine data and epidemiological models allows us to calculate the effective reproductive number of transmission as a function of relevant genetic change in the virus, illuminating the probability of influenza epidemics as a function of immunity.},

Influenza virus illustrates the interaction of factors that limit the transmission and subsequent establishment of an infection in a novel host species. Influenza species barriers can be categorized into virus-host interactions occurring within individuals and host-host interactions, either within or between species, that affect transmission between individuals. Viral evolution can help surmount species barriers, principally by affecting virus-host interactions; however, evolving the capability for sustained transmission in a new host species represents a major adaptive challenge because the number of mutations required is often large.},

title = {Alternative methods of estimating an incubation distribution: examples from severe acute respiratory syndrome},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate and precise estimates of the incubation distribution of novel, emerging infectious diseases are vital to inform public health policy and to parameterize mathematical models. METHODS: We discuss and compare different methods of estimating the incubation distribution allowing for interval censoring of exposures, using data from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 as an example. RESULTS: Combining data on unselected samples of 149 and 168 patients with defined exposure intervals from Toronto and Hong Kong, respectively, we estimated the mean and variance of the incubation period to be 5.1 day and 18.3 days and the 95th percentile to be 12.9 days. We conducted multiple linear regression on the log incubation times and found that incubation was significantly longer in Toronto than in Hong Kong and in older compared with younger patients, while it was significantly shorter in healthcare workers than in other patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest subtle but important heterogeneities in the incubation period of SARS among different strata of patients. Robust estimation of the incubation period should be independently carried out in different settings and subgroups for novel human pathogens using valid statistical methods.},
